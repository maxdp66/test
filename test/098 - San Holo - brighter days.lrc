[00:09.97]Oh
[00:14.06]
[00:14.06]Vivid visions of us carry on
[00:21.57]Think I've found the light it's been so long
[00:28.85]I better hold on to this feeling before it's gone
[00:36.17]Whatever happened we both grew as time moved on
[00:42.19]Oh-oh
[00:43.56]
[00:43.56]Feels like I'm the only one
[00:48.25]Looking at blue skies, dreaming of old times
[00:52.17]Brighter days will come
[00:55.52]Looking at blue skies, with you in my mind
[00:59.49]I'm the only one, brighter days will come
[01:06.48]Am I the only one?
[01:10.54]Looking at blue skies, dreaming of old times
[01:27.53]
[01:27.53]Dreaming of old times
[01:42.78]Dreaming of old times
[01:47.15]
[01:47.15]Flying high, I'm ten feet off the ground (off the ground)
[01:55.31]I see it all even when looking down
[02:02.33]Don't wanna hold on to the times you were around
[02:09.52]No longer hear your voice when there's no single sound
[02:17.08]
[02:17.08]Feels like I'm the only one
[02:21.72]Looking at blue skies, dreaming of old times
[02:25.69]Brighter days will come
[02:29.26]Looking at blue skies, with you in my mind
[02:33.30]I'm the only one, brighter days will come
[02:40.59]Am I the only one?
[02:44.26]Looking at blue skies, dreaming of old times
[03:00.91]
[03:00.91]Dreaming of old times
[03:17.82]
[03:17.82]Brighter days, ter days, ter days will
[03:21.68]Brighter days, ter days, ter days will
[03:25.59]Brighter days, ter days, ter days will
[03:29.05]Brighter days, ter days, ter days will
[03:32.93]
[03:32.93]Brighter days, ter days, ter days will
[03:36.50]Brighter days, ter days, ter days will
[03:40.37]Brighter days, ter days, ter days will
[03:43.70]Brighter days will come
