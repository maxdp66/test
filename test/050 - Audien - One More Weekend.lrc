[00:07.27]Let it out. We can go top down
[00:11.83]Just fade out, into the sun now
[00:16.09]Paradise, swimming in moonshine
[00:20.72]Living that good life. Baby, it's our time
[00:25.47]
[00:25.47]I'm t-t-trying to lock your love down
[00:30.54]Just give me one shot, I won't waste it now
[00:35.25]
[00:35.25]Friday night, we were faded
[00:37.84]On your lips, I could taste it
[00:39.63]If I could just keep you here, one more weekend
[00:43.72]Saturday, I was all in
[00:46.18]With you 'til six in the morning
[00:48.24]If I could just keep you here, one more weekend
[00:58.36]
[00:58.36]One more weekend
[01:02.06]If I could just
[01:06.87]One more weekend
[01:09.86]
[01:09.86]You and me, riding this daydream
[01:12.88]It's so easy the way that it should be
[01:17.25]Come alive, keep me up all night
[01:21.54]Oh, now all I want is to hit reset
[01:24.58]'Cause I'm not ready to come down yet
[01:26.85]
[01:26.85]I'm t-t-trying to lock your love down
[01:31.18]Just give me one shot, I won't waste it now
[01:36.03]
[01:36.03]Friday night, we were faded
[01:38.27]On your lips, I could taste it
[01:40.36]If I could just keep you here, one more weekend
[01:44.44]Saturday, I was all in
[01:46.97]With you 'til six in the morning
[01:49.09]If I could just keep you here, one more weekend
[01:58.77]
[01:58.77]One more weekend
[02:08.00]One more weekend
[02:11.78]
[02:11.78]If I could just, ooh
[02:17.25]Fell so deep, it went so fast though
[02:22.30]Still thinking about when time froze
[02:24.38]I won't waste it now
[02:28.19]Moon sank just outside your window
[02:30.57]You come back, I'll never let go
[02:33.00]I won't waste it now
[02:36.95]
[02:36.95]Friday night, we were faded
[02:38.85]On your lips, I could taste it
[02:41.22]If I could just keep you here, one more weekend
[02:45.28]Saturday, I was all in
[02:47.82]With you 'til six in the morning
[02:49.84]If I could just keep you here, one more weekend
[02:59.15]
[02:59.15]One more weekend
[03:04.13]If I could just
[03:08.89]One more weekend
