[00:34.71]Hey, brother, what you thinking?
[00:35.43]Leave that old record spinning
[00:38.60]You feel the rhythm, going
[00:40.61](They call it lonely digging)
[00:42.51]Let's end your time to lay low
[00:44.78]Your knees a-bending, so
[00:46.28]It's time to get up and let go
[00:48.49](You're gonna come undone)
[00:50.20]
[00:50.20]Hey, mama, how's it going?
[00:52.10]Can't see your body moving
[00:54.03]Don't leave the party dying
[00:56.19](They call it lonely digging)
[00:57.83]Your booty shaking, you know
[01:00.27]Your head has no right to say no
[01:02.03]Tonight it's ready, set, go
[01:03.99]
[01:03.99]Baby can you move it round the rhythm
[01:06.84]So we can get with 'em
[01:07.67]To the ground and get us a rock and roll round
[01:09.66]Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
[01:11.61]Let's go, yes, no, hell no
[01:12.71]Baby can you move it round the rhythm
[01:14.19]'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
[01:16.25]It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene
[01:35.66]
[01:35.66]Hey, brother, what you thinking?
[01:38.31]That good ol' sound is ringing
[01:40.33]They don't know what they're missing
[01:42.41](They call it lonely digging)
[01:44.34]Let's end your time to lay low
[01:46.16]Your knees a-bending, so
[01:48.49]It's time to get up and let go
[01:51.88]
[01:51.88]Hey, brother, nice and steady
[01:53.89]Put down your drink, you ready
[01:55.87]It's hard when things get messy
[01:57.85](They call it lonely digging)
[01:59.64]Your booty shaking, you know
[02:01.47]Your head has no right to say no
[02:03.60]Tonight it's ready, set, go
[02:13.14]
[02:13.14]Baby can you move it round the rhythm
[02:15.81]So we can get with 'em
[02:16.84]To the ground and get us a rock and roll round
[02:18.84]Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
[02:20.61]Let's go, yes, no, hell no
[02:22.34]Baby can you move it round the rhythm
[02:23.64]'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
[02:25.67]It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene
[03:15.09]
[03:15.09]Baby can you move it round the rhythm
[03:17.69]So we can get with 'em
[03:18.47]To the ground and get us a rock and roll round
[03:20.43]Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
[03:22.19]Let's go, yes, no, hell no
[03:24.19]Baby can you move it round the rhythm
[03:25.25]'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
