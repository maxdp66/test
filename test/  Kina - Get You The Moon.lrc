[00:14.96]You gave me a shoulder when I needed it
[00:23.91]You showed me love when I wasn't feeling it
[00:32.87]You helped me fight when I was giving in
[00:40.78]And you made me laugh when I was losing it
[00:49.20]
[00:49.20]'Cause you are, you are
[00:51.00]The reason why I'm still hanging on
[00:57.27]'Cause you are, you are
[00:59.08]The reason why my head is still above water
[01:04.66]And if I could I'd get you the moon
[01:08.77]And give it to you
[01:12.65]And if death was coming for you
[01:17.32]I'd give my life for you
[01:21.30]
[01:21.30]'Cause you are, you are
[01:26.26]The reason why I'm still hanging on
[01:29.44]'Cause you are, you are
[01:31.00]The reason why my head is still above water
[01:36.73]And if I could I'd get you the moon
[01:40.99]And give it to you
[01:45.00]And if death was coming for you
[01:48.80]I'd give my life for you
[01:53.23]
[01:53.23]'Cause you are, you are
[02:00.07]Oh, you are
[02:08.38]Oh, you are
[02:16.44]You are
[02:24.97]
[02:24.97]'Cause you are, you are
[02:27.80]The reason why I'm still hanging on
[02:33.04]'Cause you are, you are
[02:34.86]The reason why my head is still above water
[02:40.96]And if I could I'd get you the moon
