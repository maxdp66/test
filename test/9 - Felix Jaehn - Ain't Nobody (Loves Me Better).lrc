[00:08.07]Captured effortlessly
[00:10.18]That's the way it was
[00:12.37]Happened so naturally
[00:14.72]I did not know it was love
[00:16.66]The next thing I felt was you
[00:18.48]Holding me close
[00:20.61]What was I gonna do
[00:22.63]I let myself go
[00:24.78]
[00:24.78]And now we're flyin' through the stars
[00:27.17]I hope this night will last forever
[00:31.07]
[00:31.07]Oh oh oh oh
[00:33.96]Ain't nobody
[00:35.48]Loves me better
[00:37.40]Makes me happy
[00:39.49]Makes me feel this way
[00:41.59]Ain't nobody
[00:43.44]Loves me better than you
[01:07.25]
[01:07.25]I've been waitin' for you
[01:09.25]It's been so long
[01:11.34]I knew just what I would do
[01:13.40]When I heard your song
[01:15.52]You filled my heart with a kiss
[01:17.56]You gave me freedom
[01:19.55]You knew I could not resist
[01:21.86]I needed someone
[01:24.20]
[01:24.20]And now we're flyin' through the stars
[01:26.33]I hope this night will last forever
[01:29.31]
[01:29.31]Oh oh oh oh
[01:32.56]Ain't nobody
[01:34.49]Loves me better
[01:36.51]Makes me happy
[01:38.38]Makes me feel this way
[01:40.39]Ain't nobody
[01:43.09]Loves me better than you
[02:08.28]
[02:08.28]At first you put your arms around me
[02:11.45]Then you put your charms around me
[02:16.15]We stare into each others eyes
[02:19.82]And what we see is no surprise
[02:24.02]Got a feeling most with treasure
[02:29.22]And a love so deep we cannot measure
[02:33.92]
[02:33.92]Ain't nobody
[02:36.08]Loves me better
[02:37.71]Makes me happy
[02:39.93]Makes me feel this way
[02:42.51]Ain't nobody
[02:44.24]Loves me better than you
[02:51.50]
[02:51.50]Ain't nobody
[02:53.14]Loves me better
[02:54.89]Makes me happy
[02:57.06]Makes me feel this way
[02:59.48]Ain't nobody
[03:01.17]Loves me better than you
