[00:07.00]Summer nights all align
[00:11.45]As we drown in the moonlight
[00:14.92]We collide in plain sight
[00:18.63]Yeah, I know we'll be alright
[00:23.05]
[00:23.05]And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
[00:25.98]'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
[00:29.90]We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
[00:33.37]We made it
[00:37.05]
[00:37.05]I don't need no sleep
[00:39.74]'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
[00:43.92]Say you'll never leave
[00:46.80]Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
[00:51.29]Find myself awake at night
[00:54.53]See you through my lucid eyes
[00:58.29]Oh, I don't need no sleep
[01:01.93]'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
[01:14.33]
[01:14.33]I don't need no sleep
[01:17.00]'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
[01:37.47]
[01:37.47]Wide awake, no time to waste
[01:41.81]Make a mark on my timeline
[01:45.36]We're safe and sound, we come around
[01:48.63]We are dancing, the sun down
[01:52.88]
[01:52.88]And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
[01:56.29]'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
[02:00.04]We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
[02:03.66]We made it
[02:06.99]
[02:06.99]I don't need no sleep
[02:09.76]'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
[02:14.78]Say you'll never leave
[02:17.02]Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
[02:22.00]Find myself awake at night
[02:25.46]See you through my lucid eyes
[02:28.48]Oh, I don't need no sleep
[02:32.02]'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
[02:44.01]
[02:44.01]Oh, I don't need no sleep
[02:47.10]'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
[03:13.72]
[03:13.72]Oh, I don't need no sleep
[03:17.09]'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
