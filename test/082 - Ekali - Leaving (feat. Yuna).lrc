[00:04.14]I don't really wanna try and change your mind
[00:09.00]If you can't find a way to love me, it's alright
[00:13.47]But you don't wanna wake up alone
[00:18.62]You want someone to keep you warm
[00:24.67]
[00:24.67]And if you're cold inside I'll start a fire
[00:29.79]But you just let it die
[00:34.25]And if you're lost inside I'll be your guide
[00:39.72]The moonlight in your sky
[00:44.00]
[00:44.00]But you know, I can't stop you from leaving
[00:49.11]You know I can't stop you from leaving
[00:54.05]Everybody needs the space for breathin', yeah
[00:59.06]You know I can't stop you from leaving
[01:05.41]
[01:05.41]Every time you feel low, mm
[01:09.78]I can always be your hero
[01:14.29]Ooh, but you only think for yourself
[01:19.41]And you look out for somebody else
[01:25.40]
[01:25.40]And if you're cold inside I'll start a fire
[01:30.44]But you just let it die
[01:35.40]And if you're lost inside I'll be your guide
[01:40.78]The moonlight in your sky
[01:45.01]
[01:45.01]But you know, I can't stop you from leaving
[01:50.16]You know I can't stop you from leaving
[01:55.04]Everybody needs the space for breathin', yeah
[02:00.11]You know I can't stop you from leaving
[02:10.22]
[02:10.22]You know I can't stop you from leaving
[02:15.00]Everybody needs the space for breathin', yeah
[02:20.44]You know I can't stop you from leaving
[02:35.40]
[02:35.40]Everybody needs the space for breathin', yeah
[02:40.66]You know I can't stop you from leaving
