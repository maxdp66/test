[00:00.00]I took a pill in Ibiza
[00:02.28]To show Avicii I was cool
[00:04.48]And when I finally got sober, felt ten years older
[00:07.30]But fuck it, it was something to do
[00:09.19]I'm living out in LA
[00:11.29]I drive a sports car just to prove
[00:13.76]I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
[00:16.81]And I spend it on girls and shoes
[00:18.59]
[00:18.59]But you don't wanna be high like me
[00:20.75]Never really knowing why like me
[00:23.02]You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and
[00:25.86]All alone
[00:27.78]You don't wanna ride the bus like this
[00:30.21]Never knowing who to trust like this
[00:32.59]You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
[00:35.39]Stuck up on that stage singing
[00:37.97]All I know
[00:41.79]Are sad songs, sad songs
[00:46.79]Darling, all I know
[00:51.29]Are sad songs, sad songs
[01:04.00]
[01:04.00]I know, sad songs
[01:13.32]I know, sad songs
[01:22.86]I know, sad songs
[01:32.38]I know, sad songs
[01:34.27]
[01:34.27]I'm just a singer
[01:35.93]Who already blew his shot
[01:38.57]I get along with old timers
[01:40.06]'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
[01:43.26]And I can't keep a girl, no
[01:45.55]'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
[01:47.71]I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
[01:50.33]But the truth is I can't open up
[01:52.28]
[01:52.28]Now you don't wanna be high like me
[01:54.87]Never really knowing why like me
[01:57.26]You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and
[01:59.91]All alone
[02:01.56]You don't wanna ride the bus like this
[02:04.02]Never knowing who to trust like this
[02:06.40]You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
[02:09.21]Stuck up on that stage singing
[02:11.49]All I know
[02:15.63]Are sad songs, sad songs
[02:20.87]Darling, all I know
[02:24.97]Are sad songs, sad songs
[02:37.48]
[02:37.48]I know, sad songs
[02:46.93]I know, sad songs
[02:53.54]Sad songs
[02:56.45]I know, sad songs
[03:02.55]Sad songs
[03:05.72]I know, sad songs
