[00:02.19]Did a full 180, crazy
[00:07.07]Thinking 'bout the way I was
[00:09.82]Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
[00:14.68]But look at where I ended up
[00:18.81]I'm all good already
[00:20.68]So moved on, it's scary
[00:22.70]I'm not where you left me at all, so
[00:27.20]
[00:27.20]If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
[00:35.52]If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
[00:43.11]
[00:43.11]May, may, may, may, may, may
[00:47.03]May, may, may, may, may, may (so)

[01:06.55]May, may, may, may, may, may, may
[01:10.61]May, may, may
[01:29.57]
[01:29.57]Don't show up, don't come out
[01:33.18]Don't start caring about me now
[01:37.04]Walk away, you know how
[01:41.01]Don't start caring about me now
[01:44.30]
[01:44.30]Aren't you the guy who tried to
[01:49.22]Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
[01:52.30]Though it took some time to survive you
[01:57.04]I'm better on the other side
[02:01.30]I'm all good already
[02:02.90]So moved on, it's scary
[02:05.00]I'm not where you left me at all, so
[02:09.50]
[02:09.50]If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
[02:17.77]If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
[02:25.19]
[02:25.19]May, may, may, may, may, may
[02:28.93]May, may, may, may, may, may (so)
[02:33.05]May, may, may, may, may, may, may
[02:37.29]May, may, may, may, may, may, (oh)
