[00:24.66]
[00:24.66]They warned her, don't go there
[00:28.82]There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
[00:32.23]Then something came creeping
[00:35.07]It told her, don't you worry just

[01:16.00]She knew she was hypnotized
[01:18.71]And walking on cold thin ice
[01:22.09]Then it broke, and she awoke again
[01:28.73]Then she ran faster than
