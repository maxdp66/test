[00:08.19]Feeling my way through the darkness
[00:12.02]Guided by a beating heart
[00:15.81]I can't tell where the journey will end
[00:19.78]But I know where to start
[00:23.11]They tell me I'm too young to understand
[00:27.87]They say I'm caught up in a dream
[00:31.35]Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
[00:35.64]Well that's fine by me
[00:38.39]
[00:38.39]So wake me up when it's all over
[00:42.44]When I'm wiser and I'm older
[00:45.99]All this time I was finding myself
[00:49.59]And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
[00:54.04]
[00:54.04]So wake me up when it's all over
[00:57.59]When I'm wiser and I'm older
[01:01.73]All this time I was finding myself
[01:04.98]And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
[01:56.79]
[01:56.79]I tried carrying the weight of the world
[02:00.49]But I only have two hands
[02:04.08]I hope I get the chance to travel the world
[02:07.98]And I don't have any plans
[02:10.90]I wish that I could stay forever this young
[02:16.43]Not afraid to close my eyes
[02:19.28]Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
[02:23.13]And love is a prize
[02:26.55]
[02:26.55]So wake﻿ me up when it's all over
[02:30.35]When I'm wiser and I'm older
[02:34.15]All this time I was finding myself
[02:37.81]And I didn't know I was lost
[02:41.45]
[02:41.45]So wake me up when it's all over
[02:45.91]When I'm wiser and I'm older
[02:50.01]All this time I was finding myself
[02:52.95]And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
[02:58.16]
[02:58.16]I didn't know I was lost
[03:02.30]I didn't know I was lost
[03:06.38]I didn't know I was lost
[03:10.36]I didn't know I was lost
