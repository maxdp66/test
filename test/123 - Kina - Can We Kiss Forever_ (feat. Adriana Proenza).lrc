[00:08.70]I tried to reach you, I can't hide
[00:13.60]How strong's the feeling when we dive
[00:18.00]I crossed the ocean of my mind
[00:22.40]My wounds are healing with the salt
[00:26.60]All my senses intensified
[00:30.69]Whenever you and I, we dive
[00:35.64]I crossed the ocean of my mind
[00:39.40]But in the end I drown
[00:41.61]You push me down, down
[01:43.70]
[01:43.70]All the shame
[01:51.30]When you called my name
[02:01.51]I felt pain
[02:10.05]When you came
