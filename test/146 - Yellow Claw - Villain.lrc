[00:08.81]I still wanna talk to you sometimes
[00:13.19]And I heard that you moved on and that's fine
[00:18.09]Said you hated me, wanted space from me
[00:20.17]So I won't do a thing
[00:21.71]But I still wanna talk to you sometimes
[00:27.41]
[00:27.41]I cut you in my silver tongue
[00:29.77]You thought that we'd be something good
[00:34.00]Something good
[00:36.19]I'm sorry that I broke your heart
[00:39.10]I know I really had you hurt
[00:44.42]
[00:44.42]I'm the villain in your story, story
[00:49.09]If I were you I wouldn't call me, call me
[00:53.17]'Cause I'm the villain in your story, story
[00:57.99]If villains don't get to say sorry
[01:01.62]I'm sorry
[01:20.41]
[01:20.41]I'm sorry
[01:23.06]
[01:23.06]Do you still wanna talk to me sometimes?
[01:27.12]You called me back since the last night
[01:32.11]And it's obvious how saw the audience is on your side
[01:36.41]I know you don't wanna talk to me sometimes
[01:41.13]
[01:41.13]I cut you in my silver tongue
[01:43.18]You thought that we'd be something good
[01:47.46]Something good
[01:50.16]I'm sorry that I broke your heart
[01:53.13]I know I really had you hurt
[01:58.40]
[01:58.40]I'm the villain in your story, story
[02:03.00]If I were you I wouldn't call me, call me
[02:06.89]'Cause I'm the villain in your story, story
[02:11.43]If villains don't get to say sorry
[02:16.07]I'm sorry
[02:34.50]
[02:34.50]I'm sorry
[02:52.45]
[02:52.45]I'm sorry
