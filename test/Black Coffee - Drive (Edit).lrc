[00:18.06]I can't go fast enough
[00:21.81]To break free from the bond of your love
[00:25.85]And I ain't been strong enough
[00:29.56]To let go and let gone
[00:34.29]I can't see clear enough
[00:38.06]To look past the dust you left behind
[00:42.28]And I can't get high enough
[00:45.82]To forget why I cry (I cry, I cry)
[00:50.80]
[00:50.80]So I'll drive
[00:52.87]Ten thousand miles into the dead of night
[00:56.81]Till I run out of love for you, baby
[01:01.71]Till I've got no more love for you, baby
[01:05.94]Oh, I'll drive
[01:09.15]Ten thousand miles into the endless sky
[01:13.63]Till I run out of love for you, baby
[01:17.92]Till I've got no more love for you, baby
[01:22.40]
[01:22.40]I will drive all night
[01:26.11]I will drive all night
[01:30.24]Leave it all behind
[01:34.48]I will drive all night
[01:39.37]
[01:39.37]I paint your silhouette (I paint your silhouette)
[01:43.21]In the shadow of every headlight
[01:47.01]I turn up my radio (I turn up my radio)
[01:51.33]But I can't turn off my mind
[01:55.37]Somehow you get to me (somehow you get to me)
[01:59.13]It don't matter the distance I go
[02:03.51]Our love is dead to me (dead to me)
[02:07.54]But I believe in ghosts
[02:11.20]
[02:11.20]So I'll drive
[02:14.03]Ten thousand miles into the dead of night
[02:18.05]Till I run out of love for you, baby
[02:22.85]Till I've got no more love for you, baby
[02:27.42]
[02:27.42]I will drive all night, I will drive all night
[02:35.10]Leave it all behind, I will drive all night
[02:43.50]I will drive all night, I will drive all night
[02:50.97]Leave it all behind, I will drive all night
[02:59.51]I will drive all night
