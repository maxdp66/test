[00:15.00]Tell me somethin', girl
[00:20.46]Are you happy in this modern world?
[00:25.08]Or do you need more?
[00:30.00]Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
[00:34.87]
[00:34.87]I'm falling
[00:38.72]In all the good times I find myself
[00:43.70]Longin' for change
[00:49.76]And in the bad times I fear myself
[01:04.51]
[01:04.51]Tell me something, boy
[01:09.61]Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
[01:14.50]Or do you need more?
[01:19.58]Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?
[01:24.79]
[01:24.79]I'm falling
[01:29.20]In all the good times I find myself
[01:33.85]Longing for change
[01:39.51]And in the bad times I fear myself
[01:44.86]
[01:44.86]I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
[01:49.08]I'll never meet the ground
[01:54.20]Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
[01:58.77]We're far from the shallow now
[02:04.86]
[02:04.86]In the shallow, shallow
[02:09.28]In the shallow, shallow
[02:14.16]In the shallow, shallow
[02:18.77]We're far from the shallow now
[02:26.96]
[02:26.96]Oh, oh, oh, oh
[02:33.28]Whoah!
[02:43.58]
[02:43.58]I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
[02:49.46]I'll never meet the ground
[02:54.03]Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
[02:58.60]We're far from the shallow now
[03:05.03]
[03:05.03]In the shallow, shallow
[03:09.62]In the shallow, shallow
[03:13.99]In the shallow, shallow
[03:18.78]We're far from the shallow now
