[00:08.63]I feel, I feel the ending
[00:13.77]Before it even starts
[00:17.85]My jacket's under the table
[00:20.50]Your sneakers are right where they usually are
[00:26.23]We're a touch away from naked
[00:28.74]One touch from never changing
[00:31.01]Yeah, we know we shouldn't but
[00:32.62]We're always letting us down
[00:34.26]So drop our two cents on the carpet
[00:37.51]In your studio apartment
[00:39.60]Yeah, we know we shouldn't 'cause
[00:42.45]
[00:42.45]We go from hot, hot
[00:44.58]To slam and shut the doors till they crack
[00:47.17]We go from love, love
[00:48.72]To saying shit that we can't take back
[00:51.39]But every time that we walk out
[00:54.11]We just keep coming back
[00:55.84]Like we forget to forget
[00:57.98]Forget to forget about us
[01:00.61]Each time, time
[01:01.83]Promise this time will be the last
[01:04.48]'Cause we both know
[01:05.63]It's a mistake waking up in this bed
[01:08.69]But every time that we walk out
[01:11.22]We just keep coming back
[01:12.84]Like we forget to forget
[01:14.87]Forget to forget about us
[01:17.71]
[01:17.71]I know, I know this bedroom
[01:22.69]Better than I know mine
[01:26.83]Your boyhood still in the wardrobe
[01:29.67]You hid it away like you usually do
[01:35.56]We're a touch away from naked
[01:38.29]One touch from never changing
[01:40.09]Yeah, we know we shouldn't but
[01:41.68]We're always letting us down
[01:43.85]So drop our two cents on the carpet
[01:46.52]In your studio apartment
[01:48.73]Yeah, we know we shouldn't 'cause
[01:52.14]
[01:52.14]We go from hot, hot
[01:53.87]To slam and shut the doors till they crack
[01:56.45]We go from love, love
[01:58.01]To saying shit that we can't take back
[02:00.68]But every time that we walk out
[02:03.09]We just keep coming back
[02:04.74]Like we forget to forget
[02:06.87]Forget to forget about us
[02:09.37]Each time, time
[02:11.15]Promise this time will be the last
[02:13.68]'Cause we both know
[02:14.84]It's a mistake waking up in this bed
[02:17.90]But every time that we walk out
