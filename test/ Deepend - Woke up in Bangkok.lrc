[00:06.05]Sometimes I take a left
[00:08.35]When everything is right
[00:10.16]And I can see the road
[00:12.51]When I turn out the light
[00:14.59]I sleep under the stars
[00:16.55]And then it starts to rain
[00:18.44]Take cover in a bar
[00:20.31]And run into a friend
[00:22.41]And run into a friend
[00:24.48]And run into a friend
[00:26.55]And run into a friend
[00:28.24]Till the sun comes out again
[00:32.58]
[00:32.58]Fell asleep in LA
[00:34.35]Woke up in Bangkok
[00:36.16]Gave my soul to a babe
[00:38.17]In a pawn shop
[00:40.00]Oh my ee oh my home
[00:42.35]Could be anywhere
[00:44.13]And any road, any road
[00:45.81]Any road will take me there
[00:50.19]Any road, any road, any road
[00:56.08]
[00:56.08]Oh my ee oh my home
[00:59.95]And any road, any road
[01:01.66]Any road will take me there
[01:05.41]
[01:05.41]I may have roamed these streets
[01:08.48]A hundred times before
[01:10.61]And when I finally meet you
[01:12.35]I'll roam a hundred more
[01:14.30]
[01:14.30]And maybe we'll go north
[01:16.30]And maybe we'll go south
[01:18.34]Just to keep on rolling, rolling, rolling
[01:22.61]Is what it's all about
[01:24.32]
[01:24.32]Fell asleep in LA
[01:26.14]Woke up in Bangkok
[01:27.85]Gave my soul to a babe
[01:30.01]In a pawn shop
[01:31.93]Oh my ee oh my home
[01:34.20]Could be anywhere
[01:35.90]And any road, any road
[01:37.90]Any road will take me there
[01:41.60]
[01:41.60]Any road, any road, any road
[01:48.04]Oh my ee oh my home
[01:50.43]And any road, any road
[01:53.65]Any road will take me there
[01:55.89]
[01:55.89]Oh the last thing I remember
[01:58.24]Before she broke my heart
[02:00.38]We were riding in a rickshaw
[02:02.61]Down Sunset Boulevard
[02:04.19]And I asked her where we're going
[02:06.30]She said, "baby don't you care
[02:08.38]Any road, any road will take you there"
[02:12.29]
[02:12.29]Fell asleep in LA
[02:14.14]Woke up in Bangkok
[02:15.87]Gave my soul to a babe
[02:18.14]In a pawn shop
[02:20.19]Oh my ee oh my home
[02:22.00]Could be anywhere
[02:23.90]And any road, any road
[02:25.70]Any road will take me there
[02:29.49]
[02:29.49]Any road, any road, any road
[02:36.00]Oh my ee oh my home
[02:40.07]And any road, any road
[02:41.71]Any road will take me there
