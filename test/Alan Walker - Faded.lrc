[00:10.92]You were the shadow to my light
[00:14.10]Did you feel us
[00:18.09]Another start
[00:19.72]You fade away
[00:21.80]Afraid our aim is out of sight
[00:24.94]Wanna see us
[00:28.55]Alive
[00:31.10]
[00:31.10]Where are you now
[00:36.65]Where are you now
[00:41.47]Where are you now
[00:44.40]Was it all in my fantasy
[00:47.11]Where are you now
[00:49.74]Were you only imaginary
[00:53.43]Where are you now
[00:57.71]
[00:57.71]Atlantis
[00:59.05]Under the sea
[01:01.59]Under the sea
[01:04.56]Where are you now
[01:06.90]Another dream
[01:10.36]The monsters running wild inside of me
[01:14.16]
[01:14.16]I'm faded
[01:19.73]I'm faded
[01:23.39]So lost
[01:24.92]I'm faded
[01:30.29]I'm faded
[01:34.09]So lost
[01:35.46]I'm faded
[01:37.47]
[01:37.47]These shallow waters, never met
[01:40.65]What I needed
[01:44.23]I'm letting go
[01:45.93]A deeper dive
[01:48.28]Eternal silence of the sea
[01:51.53]I'm breathing
[01:54.70]Alive
[01:56.61]
[01:56.61]Where are you now
[02:02.71]Where are you now
[02:07.84]
[02:07.84]Under the bright
[02:09.22]But faded lights
[02:10.50]You set my heart on fire
[02:13.11]Where are you now
[02:16.18]Where are you now
[02:30.37]
[02:30.37]Where are you now
[02:33.91]Atlantis
[02:35.92]Under the sea
[02:38.60]Under the sea
[02:41.20]Where are you now
[02:43.87]Another dream
[02:47.10]The monsters running wild inside of me
[02:51.27]I'm faded
[02:56.59]I'm faded
[03:00.10]So lost
[03:01.43]I'm faded
[03:06.93]I'm faded
[03:10.49]So lost
[03:12.54]I'm faded
