[00:01.28]Spot a little hottie when I flipped out the shades
[00:04.38]Lookin' like a red Rari sittin' in a driveway
[00:06.75]Bottle of CÃ®roc with a hint of Kool-Aid
[00:09.49]She done pulled up like I'm getting rid of weeds
[00:11.91]Are you tired from running through my mind?
[00:14.22]Take a break and we can have a good time
[00:16.76]Show you moves like I'm the new James Brown
[00:19.36]Me and you should get a room right now
[00:21.89]
[00:21.89]'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
[00:24.25]You're worth more than every single chain
[00:26.76]It ain't gon' work if you don't want it to
[00:29.29]Best drink I take is when I'm sippin' you
[00:31.96]
[00:31.96]You know where I go when we're dancing
[00:34.78]Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
[00:41.66]And you look so classic, come through with that magic
[00:47.03]You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true
[01:02.02]
[01:02.02]I can take you to the room or I can take you to the beach
[01:04.46]But we gotta leave at nine 'cause I gotta get my sleep
[01:06.94]You can be that early bird, I'ma get that worm
[01:09.47]Get with me, I'll take you 'round the world
[01:12.12]
[01:12.12]'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
[01:14.45]You're worth more than every single chain
[01:16.96]Walk with a limp, it just means I'm cool
[01:19.19]Next trip I take, it's just me and you
[01:21.86]
[01:21.86]You know where I go when we're dancing
[01:24.88]Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
[01:31.58]And you look so classic, come through with that magic
[01:37.05]You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true
[01:40.83]
[01:40.83]Lil Boat
[01:41.93]You said you lovin' up north when you comin' to the A
[01:44.51]You said you need to find a crib, well, tell me where you wanna stay
[01:46.96]I know we're not too pressed for time but can you pick up on the pace
[01:49.51]I'm tired of looking at your pictures, wanna be up in your face
[01:51.88]I wanna dance with you, I wanna laugh I wanna sing
[01:54.50]Take you on the road, have you rockin' on my bling
[01:56.93]Don't know if you're the one but if you are, you'll get a ring
[01:59.47]That's later down the line, don't wanna rush these types of things
[02:02.10]I'm a mama's boy so you gotta meet my mama first
[02:05.05]As you whip the Coupe around, use the seat belt first
[02:07.38]New shoes, new clothes and a Chanel purse
[02:09.81]Vacaying in The Hamptons got a lazy curse
[02:11.65]
[02:11.65]You know where I go when we're dancing
[02:14.86]Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
[02:21.45]And you look so classic, come through with that magic
[02:27.09]You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true
