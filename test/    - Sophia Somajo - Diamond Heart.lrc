[00:12.10]Hello sweet grief
[00:13.99]I know you will be the death of me
[00:17.08]Feel like the morning after ecstasy
[00:18.97]I am drowning in an endless sea
[00:22.22]Hello old friend
[00:24.49]Here's the misery that knows no end
[00:27.02]So I am doing everything I can
[00:29.70]To make sure I never love again
[00:33.88]
[00:33.88]I wish that I did not know
[00:37.04]Where all broken lovers go
[00:39.55]I wish that my heart was made of stone
[00:44.42]Yeah if I was bulletproof
[00:47.65]I'd love you black and blue
[00:50.26]If I was solid like a jewel
[00:54.11]
[00:54.11]If I had a diamond heart
[00:57.12]Oh oh
[00:59.60]I'd give you all my love
[01:02.84]If I was unbreakable
[01:05.21]If I had a diamond heart
[01:07.50]Oh oh
[01:10.02]You could shoot me with a gun of gold
[01:12.98]If I was unbreakable
[01:15.80]
[01:15.80]I'd walk straight through the bullet
[01:18.09]Bendin' like a tulip
[01:19.51]Blue-eyed and foolish
[01:21.19]Never mind the bruises
[01:22.33]Into the fire
[01:23.50]Breakin' through the wires
[01:24.74]Give you all I've got
[01:26.33]If I had a diamond heart
[01:27.16]I'd walk straight through the dagger
[01:28.78]Never break the pattern
[01:29.87]Diamonds don't shatter
[01:31.45]Beautiful and battered
[01:32.87]Into the poison
[01:34.21]Cry you an ocean
[01:35.45]Give you all I've got
[01:36.98]
[01:36.98]Goodbye, so long
[01:39.11]I don't know if this is right or wrong
[01:41.66]Am I giving up where I belong?
[01:44.25]'Cause every station is playing our song
[01:47.39]Goodbye my love
[01:49.77]You are everything my dreams made of
[01:52.45]You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
[01:54.82]If I only were unbreakable
[01:59.15]
[01:59.15]I wish that I did not know
[02:02.34]Where all broken lovers go
[02:04.90]I wish that my heart was made of stone
[02:09.70]Yeah if I was bulletproof
[02:12.72]I'd love you black and blue
[02:16.15]If I was solid like a jewel
[02:19.68]
[02:19.68]If I had a diamond heart
[02:21.90]Oh oh
[02:24.65]I'd give you all my love
[02:28.49]If I was unbreakable
[02:29.99]If I had a diamond heart
[02:33.03]Oh oh
[02:35.29]You could shoot me with a gun of gold
[02:38.26]If I was unbreakable
[02:41.07]
[02:41.07]I'd walk straight through the bullet
[02:43.55]Bendin' like a tulip
[02:45.04]Blue-eyed and foolish
[02:46.30]Never mind the bruises
[02:47.34]Into the fire
[02:48.76]Breakin' through the wires
[02:50.19]Give you all I've got
[02:51.53]If I had a diamond heart
[02:52.27]I'd walk straight through the dagger
[02:54.13]Never break the pattern
[02:55.28]Diamonds don't shatter
[02:57.06]Beautiful and battered
[02:58.26]Into the poison
[02:59.24]Cry you an ocean
[03:00.35]Give you all I've got
[03:18.36]
[03:18.36]I'd give you all my love
[03:20.02]If I was unbreakable
[03:28.03]You could shoot me with a gun of gold
[03:31.46]If I was unbreakable
[03:33.49]I'd walk straight through the bullet
[03:35.93]Bendin' like a tulip
[03:37.33]Blue-eyed and foolish
[03:38.61]Never mind the bruises
[03:40.00]Into the fire
[03:41.30]Breakin' through the wires
[03:42.74]Give you all I've got
[03:44.18]I'd walk straight through the dagger
[03:46.47]Never break the pattern
[03:47.92]Diamonds don't shatter
[03:49.38]Beautiful and battered
[03:51.02]Into the poison
[03:52.08]Cry you an ocean
[03:54.01]Give you all I got
