[00:10.51]I know that you're calling me
[00:13.49]To light up and let the shadow
[00:16.11]That follows you underneath
[00:18.58]I know that you're calling me
[00:20.52]I don't want to play it safe
[00:23.44]'Cause I don't contend like that
[00:25.80]Just keep falling into me
[00:28.74]I know I got your back
[00:35.00]
[00:35.00]Are you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?
[00:41.45]I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
[00:46.14]Are you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?
[00:51.97]I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
[01:29.00]
[01:29.00]Whoever said it was easy
[01:31.81]They never know what we'd do
[01:34.28]Oh, when these walls fall down
[01:37.21]I'll stand by you
[01:40.07]What you believe in
[01:42.52]I'll give it to you
[01:45.19]'Cause when these walls fall down
[01:47.80]I'll stand by you
[01:50.00]
[01:50.00]Are you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?
[01:55.86]I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
[02:00.86]Are you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?
[02:06.53]I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
