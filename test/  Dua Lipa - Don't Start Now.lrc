[00:08.04]Did a full 180, crazy
[00:13.19]Thinking 'bout the way I was
[00:16.00]Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
[00:20.70]But look at where I ended up
[00:24.39]I'm all good already
[00:26.50]So moved on, it's scary

[01:07.50]Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
[01:10.20]Though it took some time to survive you
[01:15.31]I'm better on the other side
[01:18.24]I'm all good already
[01:20.70]So moved on, it's scary
[01:22.66]I'm not where you left me at all, so
