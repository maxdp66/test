[00:11.03]I like that you're broken
[00:13.22]Broken like me
[00:14.77]Maybe that makes me a fool
[00:18.60]I like that you're lonely
[00:20.99]Lonely like me
[00:22.69]I could be lonely with you
[00:26.29]
[00:26.29]I met you late night, at a party
[00:29.61]Some trust fund baby's Brooklyn loft
[00:33.59]By the bathroom, you said let's talk
[00:37.31]But my confidence is wearing off
[00:41.67]
[00:41.67]These aren't my people
[00:43.90]These aren't my friends
[00:45.52]She grabbed my face and that's when she said
[00:49.44]
[00:49.44]I like that you're broken
[00:52.28]Broken like me
[00:54.13]Maybe that makes me a fool
[00:57.71]I like that you're lonely
[00:59.98]Lonely like me
[01:01.78]I could be lonely with you
[01:20.07]
[01:20.07]There's something tragic, but almost pure
[01:23.93]Think I could love you, but I'm not sure
[01:27.93]There's something wholesome, there's something sweet
[01:31.86]Tucked in your eyes that I'd love to meet
[01:35.67]
[01:35.67]These aren't my people
[01:37.91]These aren't my friends
[01:40.10]She grabbed my face and that's when she said
[01:44.23]
[01:44.23]I like that you're broken
[01:46.55]Broken like me
[01:48.28]Maybe that makes me a fool
[01:51.79]I like that you're lonely
[01:54.42]Lonely like me
[01:56.19]I could be lonely with you
[02:14.74]
[02:14.74]Life is not a love song that we like
[02:18.52]We're all broken pieces floating by
[02:22.40]Life is not a love song, we can try
[02:26.06]To fix our broken pieces one at a time
[02:32.96]
[02:32.96]I like that you're broken
[02:34.90]Broken like me
[02:36.70]Maybe that makes me a fool
[02:40.25]I like that you're lonely
[02:42.85]Lonely like me
[02:44.59]I could be lonely with you
[02:47.99]I like that you're broken
[02:50.65]Broken like me
[02:52.41]Maybe that makes me a fool
[02:56.26]I like that you're lonely
[02:58.29]Lonely like me
[03:00.39]I could be lonely with you
