[00:01.65]I've been havin' dreams
[00:05.23]Jumpin' on a trampoline
[00:09.73]Flippin' in the air
[00:13.46]I never land, just float there
[00:17.47]As I'm looking up
[00:20.71]Suddenly the sky erupts
[00:24.97]Flames alight the trees
[00:26.54]Spread to fallin' leaves
[00:28.68]Now they're right upon me
[00:34.58]
[00:34.58]Wait if I'm on fire
[00:37.81]How am I so deep in love?
[00:42.25]When I dream of dying
[00:45.00]I never feel so loved
[00:49.76]
[00:49.76]I've been having dreams
[00:54.52]Splashin' in a summer stream
[00:58.82]Trip and I fall in
[01:02.18]I wanted it to happen
[01:06.46]My body turns to ice
[01:09.67]Crushin' weight of paradise
[01:14.08]Solid block of gold
[01:15.77]Lying in the cold
[01:17.93]I feel right at home
[01:23.37]
[01:23.37]Wait if I'm on fire
[01:27.38]How am I so deep in love?
[01:30.88]When I dream of dying
[01:34.23]I never feel so loved
[01:38.93]
[01:38.93]Wait if I'm on fire
[01:41.94]How am I so deep in love?
[01:45.92]When I dream of dying
[01:49.57]I never feel so loved
[02:02.36]
[02:02.36]I never feel so loved
[02:27.89]
[02:27.89]Wait if I'm on fire
[02:31.12]How am I so deep in love?
[02:35.01]When I dream of dying
[02:39.05]I never feel so loved
[02:43.28]
[02:43.28]Wait if I'm on fire
[02:46.13]How am I so deep in love?
[02:50.18]When I dream of dying
[02:54.16]I never feel so loved
