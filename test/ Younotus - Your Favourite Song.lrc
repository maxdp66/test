[00:09.22]With the sand in our hair we were hiding together
[00:13.42]Lying next to the waves on the shore
[00:16.93]Not a care in the world 'cause our time was forever
[00:20.92]In that moment my body was yours
[00:24.87]
[00:24.87]We were high on the night, feeling light as a feather
[00:29.02]Talkin' 'bout where we go when we're gone
[00:32.89]I could tell from your eyes you were down for whatever
[00:36.82]As you played me your favourite song
[00:40.59]
[00:40.59]And it went do, da-da, do, da-da, do, da, do
[00:45.17]Da-da, do, da-da, do, duh-do
[00:47.85]Yes it went do, da-da, do, da-da, do, da, do
[00:52.62]Da-da, do, da-da, do, duh-do
[00:55.88]And it went do, da-da, do, da-da, do, da, do
[01:00.53]Da-da, do, da-da, do, duh-do
[01:04.12]
[01:04.12]With a Gibson guitar in your arms, you were strummin'
[01:08.50]And the heavens were singin' along
[01:12.36]With the moonlight alive in your eyes, you were stunnin'
[01:16.35]As you played me your favourite song
[01:20.41]
[01:20.41]But like all good things we
[01:24.41]Had to end one day
[01:28.00]You will always be just
[01:32.15]One song away
[01:35.87]
[01:35.87]And it went do, da-da, do, da-da, do, da, do
[01:40.16]Da-da, do, da-da, do, duh-do
[01:43.71]And it went do, da-da, do, da-da, do, da, do
[01:48.06]Da-da, do, da-da, do, duh-do
[01:51.18]Yes it went do, da-da, do, da-da, do, da, do
[01:55.95]Da-da, do, da-da, do, duh-do
[01:59.57]And it went do, da-da, do, da-da, do, da, do
[02:03.97]Da-da, do, da-da, do, duh-do
[02:08.05]
[02:08.05]Now I'm back to my roots with the sound of the city
[02:11.91]All these strangers are passin' me by
[02:15.87]And I miss all the memories from when you were with me
[02:19.99]Got your favourite song on my mind
[02:25.40]
[02:25.40]And it went do, da-da, do, da-da, do, da, do (hey)
[02:29.84]Da-da, do, da-da, do, duh-do (you my favorite song)
[02:33.23]And it went do, da-da, do, da-da, do, da, do
[02:36.74](You my favorite song)
[02:37.39]Da-da, do, da-da, do, duh-do (oh no)
[02:41.94]
[02:41.94](Do, da-da, do, da-da, do, da, do)
[02:45.48](Da-da, do, da-da, do, duh-do)
