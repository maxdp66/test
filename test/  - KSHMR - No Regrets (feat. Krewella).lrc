[00:00.27]So I roll like a stone, hands up in the air
[00:05.63]I don't wanna care
[00:08.13]And I'll die with no regrets
[00:11.57]
[00:11.57]Friend of mine, I get lost on the highway
[00:15.99]The wind keeps taking me one way
[00:18.43]They all say I won't be happy where I end up
[00:22.44]Love of mine, I got good times in my blood
[00:26.70]How many bottles are too much?
[00:29.03]They all say I don't know where to stop
[00:32.63]
[00:32.63]But I don't wanna sacrifice
[00:35.28]The little things that make life worth living
[00:39.72]Life worth living
[00:42.32]
[00:42.32]So I roll like a stone, hands up in the air
[00:47.62]I don't wanna care
[00:50.38]And I'll die with no regrets
[00:53.24]I roll like a stone, everything I break
[00:58.26]And all of my mistakes
[01:00.99]I can die with no regrets
[01:12.27]
[01:12.27]I can die with no regrets
[01:14.86]
[01:14.86]I roll like a stone, hands up in the air
[01:19.58]I don't wanna care
[01:22.40]And I'll die with no regrets
[01:26.10]
[01:26.10]Friend of mine, we've had heartaches that hurt bad
[01:30.75]But no I won't turn the clock back
[01:34.11]'Cause one day we'll know it's a part of the plan, oh
[01:37.15]Love of mine, one day the sun will not rise
[01:41.39]We don't got time to waste time
[01:44.14]So I'm gonna do it while I can
[01:47.19]
[01:47.19]But I don't wanna sacrifice
[01:49.75]The little things that make life worth living
[01:54.49]Life worth living
[01:56.98]
[01:56.98]So I roll like a stone, hands up in the air
[02:02.35]I don't wanna care
[02:04.89]And I'll die with no regrets
[02:08.04]I roll like a stone, everything I break
[02:13.03]And all of my mistakes
[02:16.46]I can die with no regrets
[02:26.88]
[02:26.88]I can die with no regrets
[02:29.77]
[02:29.77]I roll like a stone, hands up in the air
[02:34.24]I don't wanna care
[02:37.36]And I'll die with no regrets
[02:40.37]I roll like a stone, everything I break
[02:44.98]And all of my mistakes
[02:47.78]I can die with no regrets
