[00:01.46]In the faded light
[00:03.41]You touch my body
[00:05.82]I can feel your hands
[00:07.65]On my skin
[00:09.87]Think you're got me right
[00:11.74]Where you want me
[00:14.05]But you're just in my way
[00:16.60]
[00:16.60]I came the party on my own
[00:20.81]Don't need nobody in my song
[00:24.80]I get down to the beat I loose control
[00:28.86]
[00:28.86]Hey oh I go
[00:31.08]So so low
[00:34.23]
[00:34.23]Boy you can cool it down
[00:36.42]I'm here to fool around
[00:38.45]Just wanna dance, dance, dance
[00:41.08]Dance, dance, dance
[00:42.85]I know you want me
[00:45.01]But I don't care baby
[00:46.74]Just wanna dance, dance, dance
[00:49.32]Dance, dance, dance
[01:05.77]
[01:05.77]Dance, dance, dance
[01:14.55]Dance, dance, dance
[01:26.63]
[01:26.63]In the shade of light
[01:28.31]You're moving closer
[01:30.62]We're on our way to cross the line
[01:35.03]Think you've got me right
[01:36.69]Where you want me
[01:39.34]But it's all in your mind
[01:41.74]
[01:41.74]I came the party on my own
[01:45.86]Don't need nobody in my song
[01:50.07]I get down to the beat I loose control
[01:53.88]
[01:53.88]Hey oh I go
[01:55.99]So so low
[01:59.13]
[01:59.13]Boy you can cool it down
[02:01.57]I'm here to fool around
[02:03.59]Just wanna dance, dance, dance
[02:06.12]Dance, dance, dance
[02:07.90]I know you want me
[02:09.59]But I don't care baby
[02:11.92]Just wanna dance, dance, dance
[02:14.39]Dance, dance, dance
[02:23.02]
[02:23.02]Dance, dance, dance
[02:31.04]Dance, dance, dance
[02:39.41]Dance, dance, dance
