[00:03.00]I came out tonight with good intentions
[00:06.46]Said I was only gonna stay for one
[00:10.09]But the moment that I get your attention
[00:14.08]I lose my head and it all comes undone
[00:17.91]
[00:17.91]Because there's someone in your bed
[00:20.39]It goes straight to my head
[00:22.27]Then I lose all my sense
[00:25.43]You know it's hard to watch you go
[00:27.98]Don't leave me here solo
[00:29.84]A few drinks and it makes me do things
[00:33.19]
[00:33.19]Lift me up
[00:41.00]Lift me up
[00:48.26]Lift me up
[00:50.72]
[00:50.72]When it kicks in, all the feelings start again
[00:54.50]Made me lose my mind and now I'm back again
[00:58.10]When it kicks in, all the feeling lights up
[01:01.00]Few drinks and it makes me do things
[01:03.79]
[01:03.79]I stumble out and pass your old apartment
[01:08.08]My heavy head, it took me to your door
[01:11.77]Emotions spinning, I can feel it starting
[01:15.61]To take control and make me trip once more
[01:19.37]
[01:19.37]Because there's someone in your bed
[01:22.03]It goes straight to my head
[01:23.87]Then I lose all my sense
[01:26.59]You know it's hard to watch you go
[01:29.64]Don't leave me here solo
[01:31.57]A few drinks and it makes me do things
[01:34.56]
[01:34.56]All because you lift me up
[01:37.32]
[01:37.32]When it kicks in, all the feelings start again
[01:40.29]Made me lose my mind and now I'm back again
[01:44.65]When it kicks in, all the feeling lights up
[01:47.08]Few drinks and it makes me do things
[01:49.91]
[01:49.91]Lift me up
[01:52.49]
[01:52.49]When it kicks in, all the feelings start again
[01:55.75]Made me lose my mind and now I'm back again
[02:00.20]When it kicks in, all the feeling lights up
[02:02.72]Few drinks and it makes me do things
[02:05.55]
[02:05.55]Lift me up
[02:12.18]Lift me up
[02:19.81]Lift me up
[02:22.77]
[02:22.77]When it kicks in, all the feelings start again
[02:26.94]Made me lose my mind and now I'm back again
[02:30.67]When it kicks in, all the feeling lights up
[02:33.34]Few drinks and it makes me do things
[02:35.98]
[02:35.98]Lift me up
[02:37.55]Up, up, up, up
[02:41.01]Up, up, up, lift me up
[02:44.95]Up, up, up, up
[02:48.61]Up, up, lift me up
