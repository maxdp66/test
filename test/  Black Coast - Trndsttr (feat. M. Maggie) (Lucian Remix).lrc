[00:00.00]Hey you, can I learn your flavour?
[00:02.71]It's brand new, now it's in the papers
[00:06.64]All I seem to see
[00:10.29]Must be something underneath
[00:13.12]Take two, I'm still tryna figure out what makes you
[00:19.07]Hard on the call, I guess it comes from your heart
[00:22.08]'Cause when your head's right, you take your time
[00:26.00]It's something about the love of things you like
[00:29.00]
[00:29.00]Fire when the strobe hits (you, you)
[00:38.24]Bet you're looking for something new
[00:43.01]I feel the heat with you staring off across the room
[00:48.41]I dare you, play your cards, boy you bet I'm a trendsetter, too
[00:57.94]Fire when the strobe hits you
[01:07.66]Bet you're looking for something new
[01:13.62]Staring of across the room
[01:21.01]Bet I'm a trendsetter, too
[01:27.08]
[01:27.08]Bulletproof on another level, I hit up the crew
[01:31.96]Select never settles, it only gets better the more you see
[01:38.31]Powerful and free, confidence is key,
[01:42.07]So watch me, figure it out
[01:45.51]It's all about what you bring to the crowd
[01:48.97]Where your preference is love, they're calling me over
[01:52.88]Set your fire on me, like what I see you getting closer
[01:57.07]
[01:57.07]Hey trendsetter, see your fire when the strobe hits you
[02:01.47]I-I-I didn't see who you came with
[02:05.99]Bet you looking for something new
[02:09.99]I feel the heat with you staring off across the room
[02:18.15]I dare you, play your cards, boy
[02:20.15]You bet I'm a trendsetter, too
[02:25.84]I feel the heat, fire when the strobe hits you
[02:33.26]Bet you looking for something new
[02:41.14]Staring off across the room
[02:49.86]Bet I'm a trendsetter, too
