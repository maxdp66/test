[00:07.33]This isn't real
[00:09.35]It's all in my head
[00:11.21]I can feel it
[00:13.16]I'm imagining this
[00:14.93]Can I wake up from this dream?
[00:18.55]Roll over, fall back to sleep please
[00:25.20]
[00:25.20]For a second, for a minute can we go?
[00:28.74]For a second, for a minute can we go?
[00:32.35]For a second, for a minute can we go?
[00:36.19]For a second, for a minute can we go?
[00:38.84]
[00:38.84]Can we go back when we were young
[00:42.06]And didn't care if we messed up?
[00:46.06]We have forever so we got lost in each other
[00:50.88]'Cause time wasn't catching, time wasn't catching us
[00:54.22]Back when we were young
[00:57.21]And didn't care if we messed up
[01:00.81]We have forever so we got lost in each other
[01:05.53]'Cause time wasn't catching, time wasn't catching us
[01:24.44]
[01:24.44]Without our paper crowns of silver and gold
[01:27.91]Without our arms and feathers and hollow bones
[01:31.90]The more I'm learning, the more I don't know
[01:35.60]I feel smaller the more I go
[01:38.45]
[01:38.45]For a second, for a minute can we go?
[01:42.06]For a second, for a minute can we go?
[01:45.72]For a second, for a minute can we go?
[01:49.48]For a second, for a minute can we go?
[01:52.20]
[01:52.20]Can we go back when we were young
[01:55.81]And didn't care if we messed up?
[01:59.52]We have forever so we got lost in each other
[02:04.27]'Cause time wasn't catching, time wasn't catching us
[02:08.00]Back when we were young
[02:10.77]And didn't care if we messed up
[02:14.32]We have forever so we got lost in each other
[02:19.10]'Cause time wasn't catching, time wasn't catching us
[02:37.31]
[02:37.31]Back when we were young
[02:40.10]And didn't care if we messed up
[02:43.76]We have forever so we got lost in each other
[02:48.64]'Cause time wasn't catching, time wasn't catching us
[02:52.23]
[02:52.23]Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na
[02:58.48]You can't catch me
[03:00.02]Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na
[03:05.60]You can't catch me
