[00:00.00]Running with the speed of light
[00:03.05]Illuminate what's left behind
[00:05.72]My feet barely touch the ground
[00:08.73]Barely make a sound
[00:11.84]Can't stop running away
[00:23.03]
[00:23.03]Can't stop running away
[00:35.80]Running away
[01:02.14]
[01:02.14]I need to run
[01:05.03]I need to run until I can't breathe
[01:07.71]Steal the air
[01:10.73]Out of my lungs
[01:11.97]Speed my own feet
[01:14.09]I can see from a distance
[01:20.10]I can see from a distance
[01:32.22]
[01:32.22]I can see from a distance
[01:43.36]I can see from a distance
[02:00.03]
[02:00.03]Can't stop running away
[02:22.15]Running, running, running away
[02:34.32]Running, running, running away
