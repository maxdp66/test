[00:01.58]I've been tryna keep my distance
[00:04.61]But in an instant, you break me down
[00:09.47]I know better than to want you
[00:12.34]But I succumb to you without a doubt
[00:17.00]
[00:17.00]Now the water is rising
[00:18.54]And I'm too tired to swim
[00:20.53]And my lungs just can't take it
[00:22.74]But I keep breathing you in, so
[00:25.25]
[00:25.25]Tell me lies, tell me painted truths
[00:28.69]Anything at all to keep me close to you
[00:33.02]Pull me under the way you do
[00:36.59]Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[00:40.63]
[00:40.63]Ohh-ohh-oh, anything at all to keep me close to you
[00:49.33]Ohh-ohh-oh, tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[00:57.23]

[01:05.29](Ohh-ohh-oh), Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[01:13.10]
[01:13.10]I'm so used to your excuses
[01:16.81]That when you bruise me I stick around
[01:21.76]No point trying to make it out now
[01:24.21]Rather be sinking, then go without
[01:28.72]
[01:28.72]And now the water is rising
[01:30.52]And I'm too tired to swim
[01:32.51]And my lungs just can't take it
[01:34.47]But I keep breathing you in, so
[01:37.08]
[01:37.08]Tell me lies, tell me painted truths
[01:40.63]Anything at all to keep me close to you
[01:45.06]Pull me under the way you do
[01:48.59]Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[01:52.89]
[01:52.89]Ohh-ohh-oh, anything at all to keep me close to you
[02:01.03]Ohh-ohh-oh, tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[02:08.94]
[02:08.94](Ohh-ohh-oh), Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[02:16.93](Ohh-ohh-oh), Tonight I wanna drown in an ocean of you
[02:25.20]
