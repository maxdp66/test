[00:08.08]I watched you sleep last night
[00:12.20]Only for a moment, that's all
[00:16.84]It was bittersweet when I gently kissed your shoulder
[00:24.45]And in a moment it was over
[00:27.21]That's what your note said when I read it this morning
[00:30.57]Said you knew I was going but a year on the road and
[00:33.94]You needed more than a moment with me
[00:36.80]Everything golden, glitter and diamonds
[00:39.87]But I can't keep holding on to this cruel fantasy
[00:45.33]When you knew that I would drink your bathwater
[00:48.71]Beat the pussy all the way up to the pedestal
[00:51.00]Thought about just for you, no lie, never lie
[00:55.09]I would've been faithful, do that for us
[00:57.66]'Cause everybody deserves trust, sometimes
[01:03.21]
[01:03.21]Maybe in another life, another life
[01:06.44]Another life, another life
[01:08.64]Another life, another life, ooh
[01:12.38]Maybe in another life, another life
[01:15.62]Another life, another life
[01:17.87]Another life, another life, yeah
[01:22.11]
[01:22.11]I felt you leave last night
[01:26.05]I thought I was dreaming, that's all
[01:31.05]Was all too real when I opened my eyes
[01:34.91]And saw your letter on a pillow
[01:38.12]But I had a feeling it was coming, oh
[01:41.09]I know I was going but a year on the road and
[01:44.25]And I knew that you needed more than just a moment of love, yeah
[01:49.82]Anything, everything golden, glitter and diamonds
[01:53.60]But I can't keep holding you to this cruel fantasy, ooh
[01:59.72]Maybe in another life we might collide and then
[02:02.96]The stars would align again
[02:06.25]Another life, another life
[02:08.82]Maybe in another time we would be bound and then
[02:12.24]Our love would be found again
[02:15.21]Another life
[02:16.99]
[02:16.99]Maybe in another life, another life
[02:20.07]Another life, another life
[02:22.30]Another life, another life
[02:25.96]Maybe in another life, another life
[02:29.32]Another life, another life
[02:31.57]Another life, another life, another life
[02:35.55]
[02:35.55]Maybe in another life, another life
[02:38.51]Another life, another life
[02:40.83]Another life, another life
[02:43.31]Another life, maybe in another life, another life
[02:47.79]Another life, another life
[02:50.09]Another life, another life
[02:52.36]Another life, another life
[03:01.49]
[03:01.49]Another life, another life
