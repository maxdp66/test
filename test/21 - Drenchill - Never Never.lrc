[00:04.70]Never never, never never
[00:12.20]I don't wanna hurt forever
[00:15.51]
[00:15.51]You used to be my song, love was the melody
[00:18.98]But now you overplayed it so much to make me hate it
[00:22.79]Her kisses in your phone, I found it on our bed
[00:26.70]Hurts more than betrayal, the fact that you never failed to
[00:30.42]
[00:30.42]Trick my mind, telling me the perfect lies
[00:33.33]Didn't want to see the signs
[00:35.21]Time after time, time after time
[00:38.05]It's okay, you belong to yesterday
[00:40.95]Never gonna make me stay
[00:42.89]This time I swear, this time I say
[00:49.57]
[00:49.57]Never never, never never
[00:57.81]I don't wanna, hurt forever
[01:01.06]I will never, never, never, never, never, never love
[01:05.35]Never never, hurt forever
[01:08.66]I will never, never, never, never, never, never love
[01:13.00]Never never, never again
[01:16.55]
[01:16.55]Nothing is set in stone, that's what I heard you say
[01:20.10]Fighting a losing battle, scores you can never settle
[01:23.88]I call you by your name, my favorite mistake
[01:27.65]Hurts more than betrayal, the fact that you never failed to
[01:31.41]
[01:31.41]Trick my mind, telling me the perfect lies
[01:34.27]Didn't want to see the signs
[01:36.24]Time after time, time after time
[01:38.57]It's okay, you belong to yesterday
[01:41.85]Never gonna make me stay
[01:43.91]This time I swear, this time I say
[01:50.99]
[01:50.99]Never never, never never
[01:58.69]I don't wanna, hurt forever
[02:02.00](Forever, forever, forever, forever)
[02:06.35]Never never, never again
[02:14.26]
[02:14.26]Never never, never never
[02:21.76]I don't wanna, hurt forever
[02:24.74]I will never, never, never, never, never, never love
[02:29.21]Never never, hurt forever
[02:32.53]I will never, never, never, never, never, never love
[02:36.93]Never never, never again
