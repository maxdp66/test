[00:11.40]Can you explain to me how
[00:18.60]You're so evil, how?
[00:26.08]It's too late for me now
[00:31.11]There's a hole in the earth
[00:34.18]I'm out
[00:41.00]
[00:41.00]There's a hole in the earth
[00:43.34]I'm out
[01:01.61]There's a hole in the earth
[01:28.50]
[01:28.50]Can you explain to me now
[01:35.56]If you're still able? Well
[01:43.09]I think you know the truth
[01:48.12]There's a hole in the earth
[01:50.77]I'm out
[01:54.00]
[01:54.00]I hate all of my friends
[02:01.90]They all lack taste sometimes
[02:07.40]
[02:07.40]There's a hole in the earth
[02:10.02]I'm out
[02:13.60]There's a hole in the earth
[02:45.90]
[02:45.90]Please take a bow
[02:50.62]This is the end
[02:54.54]Somewhere
[02:57.00]This is the end
[03:07.30]Somewhere
[03:09.50]
[03:09.50]There's a hole in the earth
[03:35.84]
[03:35.84](This is the end)
[04:00.50]
[04:00.50]There's a hole in the earth
