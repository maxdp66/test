[00:10.00]We were young, posters on the wall
[00:12.58]Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
[00:15.79]We would stare at each other
[00:18.69]'Cause we were always in trouble
[00:20.58]
[00:20.58]And all the cool kids did their own thing
[00:23.23]I was on the outside, always looking in
[00:26.06]Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
[00:29.00]They never really cared if I was in
[00:31.72]
[00:31.72]We all need that someone
[00:34.96]Who gets you like no one else
[00:37.95]Right when you need it the most
[00:42.00]We all need a soul to rely on
[00:45.67]A shoulder to cry on
[00:48.47]A friend through the highs and the lows
[00:52.97]
[00:52.97]I'm not gonna make it alone
[00:54.75]La-la-la-la-la la
[00:56.05]La-la-la-la-la 'lone
[00:58.18]I'm not gonna make it alone
[01:00.18]La-la-la-la-la la
[01:01.53]La-la-la-la-la 'lone
[01:03.81]
[01:03.81]Then I saw your face, your forgiving eyes
[01:07.16]Looking back at me from the other side
[01:09.84]Like you understood me
[01:12.62]And I'm never letting you go, oh
[01:16.01]
[01:16.01]We all need that someone
[01:18.48]Who gets you like no one else
[01:21.63]Right when you need it the most
[01:25.47]We all need a soul to rely on
[01:29.34]A shoulder to cry on
[01:32.12]A friend through the highs and the lows
[01:36.72]
[01:36.72]I'm not gonna make it alone
[01:38.51]La-la-la-la-la la
[01:39.78]La-la-la-la-la 'lone
[01:41.88]I'm not gonna make it alone
[01:43.88]La-la-la-la-la la
[01:45.22]La-la-la-la-la 'lone
[01:47.34]
[01:47.34]I'm not gonna make it alone
[01:49.32]La-la-la-la-la la
[01:50.69]La-la-la-la-la 'lone
[01:52.79]I'm not gonna make it alone
[01:54.84]La-la-la-la-la la
[01:56.17]La-la-la-la-la 'lone
[01:58.29]
[01:58.29]I'm not gonna make it alone
[02:01.07]La-la-la-la-la-la 'lone
[02:03.73]I'm not gonna make it alone
[02:05.42]La-la-la-la-la la
[02:07.05]La-la-la-la-la 'lone
[02:10.47]
[02:10.47]'Cause you are that someone
[02:13.02]That gets me like no one else
[02:16.20]Right when I need it the most
[02:20.56]And I'll be the one you rely on
[02:23.87]A shoulder to cry on
[02:26.64]A friend through the highs and the lows
[02:31.27]
[02:31.27]I'm not gonna make it alone
[02:33.02]La-la-la-la-la la
[02:34.27]La-la-la-la-la-la 'lone
[02:36.37]I'm not gonna make it alone
[02:38.41]La-la-la-la-la la
[02:39.78]La-la-la-la-la-la 'lone
[02:41.89]
[02:41.89]I'm not gonna make it alone
[02:43.85]La-la-la-la-la la
[02:45.23]La-la-la-la-la-la 'lone
[02:47.28]I'm not gonna make it alone
[02:49.34]La-la-la-la-la la
[02:50.69]La-la-la-la-la-la 'lone
[02:52.69]I'm not gonna make it alone
