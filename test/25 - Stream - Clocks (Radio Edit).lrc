[00:06.13]The lights go out and I can't be saved
[00:10.73]Tides that I tried to swim against
[00:14.31]Have brought me down upon my knees
[00:18.05]Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing
[00:22.63]
[00:22.63]Come out of the things unsaid
[00:25.87]Shoot an apple off my head and a
[00:30.35]Trouble that can't be named
[00:33.41]A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing
[00:38.97]
[00:38.97]You are, you
[01:08.44]
[01:08.44]Confusion that never stops
[01:11.96]The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna
[01:16.36]Come back and take you home
[01:19.67]I could not stop, that you now know, singing
[01:24.41]
[01:24.41]Come out upon my seas
[01:27.33]Cursed missed opportunities am I
[01:31.94]A part of the cure
[01:35.01]Or am I part of the disease, singing
[01:56.15]
[01:56.15]You are, you are
[02:11.13]You are, you are
[02:25.26]
[02:25.26]Home, home, where I wanted to go
[02:32.64]Home, home, where I wanted to go
[02:40.27]
[02:40.27]You, you are
