[00:14.16]What you promisin' me?
[00:17.12]Soon as we, soon as we get home
[00:20.26]Introduce me to the sheets again
[00:23.46]
[00:23.46]Take your hands, put 'em on me
[00:25.92]Generate the motions alone
[00:29.21]Well, you better lead below me
[00:32.12]We move like an ocean, oh
[00:35.28]
[00:35.28]Falling down but it feels like flying
[00:38.18]What you doin' to me?
[00:41.59]And I don't care if we crash this party
[00:44.33]As long as you are with me
[00:46.96]I know I'm falling but it feels like flying
[00:50.41]What you doin' to me?
[00:52.75]And I don't care if we crash this party
[00:56.21]As long as you are with me
[01:11.77]

[01:19.70]And you're answering the call again
[01:22.96]
[01:22.96]Take your hands, put 'em on me
[01:25.58]Generate the motions, love
[01:28.68]Well, you better lead below me
[01:31.85]We move like an ocean, ooh
[01:34.84]
[01:34.84]Falling down but it feels like flying
[01:37.81]What you doin' to me?
[01:40.24]And I don't care if we crash this party
[01:43.90]As long as you are with me
[01:46.41]I know I'm falling but it feels like flying
[01:50.02]What you doin' to me?
[01:52.05]And I don't care if we crash this party
[01:55.61]As long as you are with me
