[00:09.55]The club isn't the best place to find a lover
[00:12.15]So the bar is where I go
[00:14.18]Me and my friends at the table doing shots
[00:16.90]Drinking fast and then we talk slow
[00:19.13]Come over and start up a conversation with just me
[00:22.06]And trust me I'll give it a chance now
[00:24.56]Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
[00:27.06]And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
[00:29.64]
[00:29.64]Girl, you know I want your love
[00:31.92]Your love was handmade for somebody like me
[00:34.94]Come on now, follow my lead
[00:36.92]I may be crazy, don't mind me
[00:39.50]Say, boy, let's not talk too much
[00:41.98]Grab on my waist and put that body on me
[00:44.93]Come on now, follow my lead
[00:46.93]Come, come on now, follow my lead
[00:50.85]
[00:50.85]I'm in love with the shape of you
[00:52.95]We push and pull like a magnet do
[00:55.35]Although my heart is falling too
[00:57.80]I'm in love with your body
[01:00.62]And last night you were in my room
[01:03.09]And now my bedsheets smell like you
[01:05.49]Every day discovering something brand new
[01:07.85]I'm in love with your body
[01:10.06]Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
[01:12.93]I'm in love with your body
[01:14.67]Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

[01:22.78]I'm in love with your body
[01:25.05]Every day discovering something brand new
[01:27.88]I'm in love with the shape of you
[01:30.07]
[01:30.07]One week in we let the story begin
[01:31.98]We're going out on our first date
[01:34.43]You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
[01:37.00]Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
[01:39.64]We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
[01:42.07]And how your family is doing okay
[01:44.39]Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
[01:47.10]Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
[01:49.55]
[01:49.55]Girl, you know I want your love
[01:52.02]Your love was handmade for somebody like me
[01:54.87]Come on now, follow my lead
[01:56.72]I may be crazy, don't mind me
[01:59.28]Say, boy, let's not talk too much
[02:01.81]Grab on my waist and put that body on me
[02:05.05]Come on now, follow my lead
[02:06.70]Come, come on now, follow my lead

[02:44.41]Every day discovering something brand new
[02:48.01]I'm in love with the shape of you
