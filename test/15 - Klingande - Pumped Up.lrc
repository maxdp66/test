[00:00.01]All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
[00:02.69]You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
[00:07.26]
[00:07.26]I know a story about a boy
[00:10.86]About a boy I used to know
[00:15.61]It's kind of funny, you'd never guess
[00:18.88]As he smokes a cigarette
[00:22.69]
[00:22.69]I used to lie
[00:26.10]I could've shown this kid the road
[00:30.65]Follow the lines
[00:34.16]Instead of doing this alone
[00:36.86]And he was singing
[00:38.33]
[00:38.33]All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
[00:41.87]You better run, better run, outrun my gun
[00:45.41]All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
[00:49.63]You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
[01:07.59]
[01:07.59]Faster than my bullet
[01:12.11]
[01:12.11]I saw his face from behind the door
[01:15.13]A look so pure, I could've sworn
[01:19.68]It's not so funny, it's just a mess
[01:23.01]Another cowboy in distress
[01:26.73]
[01:26.73]I used to lie
[01:30.57]I could've shown this kid the road
[01:34.52]Follow the lines
[01:38.11]Instead of doing this alone
[01:41.33]And he was singing
[01:43.11]
[01:43.11]All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
[01:46.32]You better run, better run, outrun my gun
[01:50.38]All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
[01:54.15]You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
[01:58.33]All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
[02:01.60]You better run, better run, outrun my gun
[02:06.03]All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
[02:09.69]You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
[02:27.65]
[02:27.65]Faster than my bullet
[02:29.93]
[02:29.93]All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
[02:33.33]You better run, better run, outrun my gun
[02:37.50]All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
[02:41.35]You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
[02:45.46]
[02:45.46]All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
[02:49.24]You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
