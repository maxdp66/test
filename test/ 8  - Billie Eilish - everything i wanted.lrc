[00:17.40]I had a dream
[00:20.44]I got everything I wanted
[00:25.22]Not what you'd think
[00:28.80]And if I'm being honest
[00:30.84]
[00:30.84]It might've been a nightmare
[00:34.69]To anyone who might care
[00:41.27]Thought I could fly (fly)
[00:44.62]So I stepped off the Golden, mm
[00:49.32]Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)
[00:52.77]Nobody even noticed
[00:54.87]I saw them standing right there
[00:58.96]Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)
[01:05.26]
[01:05.26]I had a dream
[01:08.48]I got everything I wanted
[01:11.71]But when I wake up, I see
[01:16.02]You with me
[01:19.17]
[01:19.17]And you say, "As long as I'm here
[01:24.39]No one can hurt you
[01:28.52]Don't wanna lie here
[01:32.42]But you can learn to
[01:36.47]If I could change
[01:39.53]The way that you see yourself
[01:44.31]You wouldn't wonder why you hear
[01:48.33]They don't deserve you"
[01:53.14]
[01:53.14]I tried to scream
[01:56.44]But my head was underwater
[02:01.35]They called me weak
[02:04.28]Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
[02:06.88]
[02:06.88]Coulda been a nightmare
[02:10.43]But it felt like they were right there
[02:15.52]And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
[02:19.82]But I don't wanna let anybody know
[02:23.73]'Cause everybody wants something from me now
[02:27.80]And I don't wanna let 'em down
[02:33.21]
[02:33.21]I had a dream
[02:36.60]I got everything I wanted
[02:39.78]But when I wake up, I see
[02:43.90]You with me
[02:47.30]
[02:47.30]And you say, "As long as I'm here
[02:52.48]No one can hurt you
[02:56.36]Don't wanna lie here
[03:00.44]But you can learn to
[03:04.47]If I could change
[03:07.57]The way that you see yourself
[03:12.22]You wouldn't wonder why you hear
[03:16.60]They don't deserve you"
[03:20.05]
[03:20.05]If I knew it all then would I do it again?
[03:24.25]Would I do it again?
[03:28.15]If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
[03:32.22]What would they say instead?
[03:35.98]If I knew it all then would I do it again?
[03:40.21]Would I do it again?
[03:43.87]If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
[03:48.22]What would they say instead?
