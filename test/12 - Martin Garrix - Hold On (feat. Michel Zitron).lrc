[00:00.59]Afraid you've lost it all
[00:04.59]Unsure what the future holds
[00:06.92]And now, I can hear your call tonight
[00:15.77]
[00:15.77]Too late to turn back now
[00:18.87]And you'll be safe and sound
[00:22.53]I know that we'll make it through the night
[00:29.50]
[00:29.50]I, I'll dry every river in your eyes
[00:34.51]I'll light up the darkness in your mind
[00:38.24]Remember when life is so unfair
[00:41.51]Hold on, hold on, we're almost there
[00:45.66]Whenever the storm is closing in
[00:49.50]I'll fight all your demons and your sins
[00:53.22]And when you feel lost, now don't be scared
[00:56.89]Hold on, hold on, we're almost there
[01:11.90]
[01:11.90]Hold on, hold on, we're almost there
[01:27.11]Hold on, hold on, we're almost there
[02:15.44]
[02:15.44]Towards a brand new light
[02:19.23]We travel side by side
[02:22.15]I know it's time to leave the pain behind
[02:30.35]There's a place where we can grow
[02:33.91]From now until we're grey and old
[02:37.15]I know the love we long for, we will find
[02:44.01]
[02:44.01]I, I'll dry every river in your eyes
[02:49.57]I'll light up the darkness in your mind
[02:53.36]Remember when life is so unfair
[02:57.00]Hold on, hold on, we're almost there
[03:00.98]Whenever the storm is closing in
[03:04.80]I'll fight all your demons and your sins
[03:08.16]And when you feel lost, now don't be scared
[03:11.48]Hold on, hold on, we're almost there
[03:15.52]
[03:15.52](We're almost there, we're almost there)
[03:19.10](We're almost there, we're almost there)
[03:26.27]
[03:26.27]Hold on, hold on, we're almost there
[03:56.74]
[03:56.74]Hold on, hold on, we're almost there
