[00:11.92]You and I got that deal, babe
[00:14.82]'Til it all goes down
[00:17.76]Had my goals on the front page
[00:20.73]And now they're nowhere around
[00:23.69]
[00:23.69]I don't wanna feel this way
[00:26.41]Say goodbye to sleepless nights
[00:29.20]Don't know how I'm gonna turn away
[00:32.34]I don't wanna lose more time
[00:34.63]
[00:34.63]I'm so distracted underneath your lies
[00:40.71]I get a reaction looking in your eyes
[00:46.71]Such an attraction, oh
[00:49.72]Win it all and lose my mind
[00:52.56]Beautiful distraction, oh
[00:55.44]Let me go and I'll be fine
[01:11.72]
[01:11.72]It's too bad 'cause you're perfect
[01:14.94]Everything I'd ever wanted
[01:17.44]But you're killing all my progress
[01:21.06]Just so you can feel love, yeah
[01:23.76]
[01:23.76]I don't wanna feel this way
[01:26.54]Say goodbye to sleepless nights
[01:29.36]Don't know how I'm gonna turn away
[01:32.40]I don't wanna lose more time
[01:34.61]
[01:34.61]I'm so distracted underneath your lies
[01:40.12]I get a reaction looking in your eyes
[01:46.71]Such an attraction, oh
[01:49.37]Win it all and lose my mind
[01:52.50]Beautiful distraction, oh
[01:55.11]Let me go and I'll be fine
