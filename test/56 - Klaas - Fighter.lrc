[00:02.55]One look in the mirror
[00:06.13]I recognize the face that I see
[00:10.31]It's getting clearer
[00:13.66]The scars that you like mean nothing to me
[00:17.84]Sometimes I feel like falling
[00:21.02]But you're not around to hold or catch me
[00:25.17]I hear the voices calling
[00:28.39]But when I give in they disappear
[00:32.40]
[00:32.40]'Cause I'm a fighter, a fighter
[00:35.68]I'm not gonna give up, I'm not gonna stop
[00:39.43]'Cause I'm a fighter, a fighter
[00:43.39]I'm not gonna give up, I'm not gonna drop
[00:46.84]'Cause I can fight, fight, fight
[00:50.56]I can fight to the end
[00:54.85]Yeah, I can fight, fight, fight
[00:58.81]If I fall, I'll just get up and start over again
[01:08.91]I'll just get up and start over again
[01:16.04]Start over again
[01:24.10]
[01:24.10]You're playing with fire
[01:26.75]Now, I'm waking up the demon in me
[01:31.02]My inner desire
[01:34.58]A life on the edge is too much for me
[01:38.42]
[01:38.42]Sometimes I feel like falling
[01:41.35]But you're not around to hold or catch me
[01:45.78]I hear the voices calling
[01:49.21]But when I give in they disappear
[01:53.32]
[01:53.32]'Cause I'm a fighter, a fighter
[01:56.73]I'm not gonna give up, I'm not gonna stop
[02:00.45]'Cause I'm a fighter, a fighter
[02:04.05]I'm not gonna give up, I'm not gonna drop
[02:08.17]'Cause I can fight, fight, fight
[02:11.32]I can fight to the end
[02:15.61]Yeah, I can fight, fight, fight
[02:19.46]If I fall, I'll just get up and start over again
[02:29.36]I'll just get up and start over again
[02:36.12]Start over again
