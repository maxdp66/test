[00:00.75]You and I are young and broken
[00:03.45]We both have shit to cope with
[00:06.11]One word before we fall apart
[00:10.40]You and I, we'll make up reasons
[00:13.43]Afraid to show our feelings
[00:16.08]Skip out the complicated parts
[00:19.44]
[00:19.44]Oh oh, where did we go wrong?
[00:24.33]I thought I told you from the start that I would rather be alone
[00:30.38]Oh oh, where did we go wrong?
[00:34.94]'Cause you told me from the start that you'd be better on your own
[00:40.70]
[00:40.70]But now we're moving in too close
[00:44.02]Your hands slip underneath my clothes
[00:46.43]My head is telling me no
[00:48.41]But my body ain't listening, oh oh
[00:51.48]I think we're going in too deep
[00:53.77]But you got everything I need
[00:56.21]My head is telling me no
[00:58.81]But my body ain't listening
[01:00.97]
[01:00.97]Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
[01:05.91]My head is telling me no
[01:08.80]But my body ain't listening
[01:10.89]Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
[01:16.13]My head is telling me no
[01:18.84]But my body ain't listening
[01:21.80]
[01:21.80]Guess it's way too late to turn back
[01:24.58]My heart is beating too fast
[01:26.83]Naive to think that I could run away
[01:31.24]We can make these fake excuses
[01:34.33]But baby, who we foolin'?
[01:36.89]We're just too scared to mess it up again, yeah
[01:41.87]
[01:41.87]Oh, where did we go wrong?
[01:45.94]I thought I told you from the start that I would rather be alone
[01:51.47]Oh oh, where did we go wrong?
[01:55.94]'Cause you told me from the start that you'd be better on your own
[02:00.93]
[02:00.93]But now we're moving in too close
[02:04.38]Your hands slip underneath my clothes
[02:06.88]My head is telling me no
[02:08.82]But my body ain't listening
[02:11.21]
[02:11.21]Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
[02:15.61]My head is telling me no
[02:18.84]But my body ain't listening
[02:21.19]Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
[02:25.79]My head is telling me no
[02:28.89]But my body ain't listening
[02:31.63]
[02:31.63]A feeling comes over me and I gotta listen
[02:34.86]Discover I'm not giving in to my inhibitions
[02:37.44]Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
[02:41.81]
[02:41.81]But now we're moving in too close
[02:44.92]Your hands slip underneath my clothes
[02:47.89]And my body ain't listening
[02:51.51]
[02:51.51]Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
[02:55.55]Yeah, yeah, yeah
[02:57.36]My head is telling me no
[02:59.41]But my body ain't listening
[03:01.71]Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
[03:07.41]My head is telling me no
[03:09.67]But my body ain't listening
