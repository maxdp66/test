[00:08.00]Stop, too much, enough
[00:10.34]My heart keeps telling me "Take the summer off"
[00:15.47]Just to get away from all this crap stuff
[00:19.29]Everything is work, work, sleep, get back up
[00:22.91]
[00:22.91]Ocean breeze, roll across my skin
[00:26.62]Touching me within, ocean breeze
[00:30.60]Ocean breeze, cool my aching heart
[00:34.64]Heal my hidden scars, ocean breeze
[00:56.28]
[00:56.28]Stop, wake up, I am
[00:58.89]Walking in slow motion, barefoot on the sand
[01:03.61]I'm just headed straight to this promised land
[01:07.87]All I do is smile, I ain't got no plans
[01:27.21]
[01:27.21]Ocean breeze, roll across my skin
[01:31.35]Touching me within, ocean breeze
[01:35.35]Ocean breeze, cool my aching heart
[01:39.29]Heal my hidden scars, ocean breeze
[02:00.66]
[02:00.66]Stop, too much, stop, enough
[02:04.42]My heart keeps telling me "Take the summer off"
[02:08.42]Stop, too much, stop, enough
[02:12.33]My heart keeps telling me "Take the summer off"
[02:15.62]
[02:15.62]Ocean breeze, roll across my skin
[02:19.43]Touching me within, ocean breeze
[02:23.46]Ocean breeze, cool my aching heart
[02:28.01]Heal my hidden scars, ocean breeze
[02:31.64]
[02:31.64](Shake it down)
[02:39.20]
[02:39.20]Ocean breeze
[02:48.18]
[02:48.18]Ocean breeze, roll across my skin
[02:51.40]Touching me within, ocean breeze
[02:55.63]Ocean breeze, cool my aching heart
[02:59.49]Heal my hidden scars, ocean breeze
