[00:06.34]No, no, no
[00:22.47]
[00:22.47]I still see your shadows in my room
[00:25.66]Can't take back the love that I gave you
[00:28.46]It's to the point where I love and I hate you
[00:31.14]And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
[00:34.71]Easier said than done
[00:36.49]I thought you were the one
[00:37.54]Listening to my heart instead of my head
[00:40.22]You found another one, but
[00:41.98]I am the better one
[00:43.24]I won't let you forget me
[00:44.43]I still see your shadows in my room
[00:48.42]Can't take back the love that I gave you
[00:51.55]It's to the point where I love and I hate you
[00:53.99]And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
[00:57.40]Easier said than done
[00:59.03]I thought you were the one
[01:00.35]Listening to my heart instead of my head
[01:02.99]You found another one, but
[01:04.74]I am the better one
[01:06.01]I won't let you forget me
[01:08.33]
[01:08.33]You left me falling and landing inside my grave
[01:14.03]I know that you want me dead
[01:19.59]I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
[01:25.32]I know it's all in my head
[01:30.95]
[01:30.95]I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
[01:36.85]Thinking of you in my bed
[01:42.33]You were my everything
[01:45.32]Thoughts of a wedding ring
[01:48.21]Now I'm just better off dead
[01:53.79]I'll do it over again
[01:55.68]I didn't want it to end
[01:57.10]I watch it blow in the wind
[01:58.53]I should've listened to my friends
[01:59.94]Did this shit in the past
[02:01.44]But I want it to last
[02:02.91]You were made outta plastic (fake)
[02:05.48]I was tangled up in your drastic ways
[02:08.18]Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?
[02:10.91]You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
[02:13.74]I gave you my heart and you made heart break
[02:16.87]
[02:16.87]You made my heart break
[02:19.46]You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
[02:22.57]You made my heart break
[02:25.17]You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
[02:28.33]You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)
[02:31.12]You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
[02:34.03]You made my heart break again (I was tangled up your drastic ways)
[02:36.83](Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?)
[02:39.69]
[02:39.69]I still see your shadows in my room
[02:42.28]Can't take back the love that I gave you
[02:45.19]It's to the point where I love and I hate you
[02:47.38]And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)

[02:59.72]I won't let you forget me
[03:01.86]I still see your shadows in my room
[03:04.83]Can't take back the love that I gave you
[03:07.59]It's to the point where I love and I hate you
[03:10.36]And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)

[03:15.19]I thought you were the one
[03:16.68]Listening to my heart instead of my head
[03:19.16]You found another one, but
[03:21.22]I am the better one
[03:22.40]I won't let you forget me
[03:24.85]
