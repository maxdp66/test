[00:00.76]And all I am is a man
[00:04.92]I want the world in my hands
[00:08.70]I hate the beach
[00:10.70]But I stand
[00:12.53]in California with my toes in the sand
[00:15.99]Use the sleeves of my sweater
[00:18.30]Let's have an adventure
[00:20.05]Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
[00:24.35]Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
[00:28.20]You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh
[00:33.34]
[00:33.34](She knows what I think about)
[00:35.47](And what I think about)
[00:37.18](One love, two mouths)
[00:38.86](One love, one house)
[00:40.72](No shirt, no blouse)
[00:42.61](Just us, you find out)
[00:44.55](Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no)
[00:47.38]
[00:47.38]'Cause it's too cold for you here
[00:54.09]And now, so let me hold
[00:59.03]Both your hands in
[01:01.83]the holes of my sweater
[01:03.03]And it's too cold for you here
[01:09.37]And, hold, hold
[01:14.00]Both your hands in
[01:16.62]the holes of my sweater
[01:18.70]
[01:18.70]And if I may just take your breath away
[01:21.03]I don't mind if there's not much to say
[01:22.87]Sometimes the silence guides your minds
[01:24.88]To move to a place so far away
[01:26.84]The goosebumps start to raise
[01:28.40]The minute that my left hand meets your waist
[01:30.72]And then I watch your face
[01:32.14]Put my finger on your tongue
[01:33.45]'Cause you love the taste, yeah
[01:35.06]And these hearts adore
[01:36.16]Everyone the other beats hardest for
[01:37.97]Inside this place is warm
[01:39.89]Outside it starts to pour
[01:41.93]
[01:41.93]Comin' down
[01:44.09]One love, two mouths
[01:45.73]One love, one house
[01:47.56]No shirt, no blouse
[01:49.47]
[01:49.47]Just us, you find out
[01:51.57]Nothing that we wouldn't wanna tell you about
[01:53.49]No, no, no
[01:55.71]
[01:55.71]'Cause it's too cold for you here
[02:02.86]And now, so let me hold
[02:07.71]Both your hands in
[02:10.23]the holes of my sweater
[02:11.53]And it's too cold for you here
[02:18.11]And now, so let me hold
[02:23.26]Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
[02:27.13]And it's too cold for you here
[02:33.48]And now, so let me hold
[02:38.57]Both your hands in
[02:40.58]The holes of my sweater
