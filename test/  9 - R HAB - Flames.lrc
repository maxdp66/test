[00:09.65]Well, well, you better run from me
[00:13.97]You better hit the road
[00:17.08]You better up and leave
[00:20.26]Don't get too close
[00:23.37]'Cause I'm a rolling stone
[00:26.64]And I keep rolling on
[00:29.87]You better run from me
[00:32.93]Before I take your soul
[00:36.43]
[00:36.43]If I go, let me go
[00:42.66]Don't you follow me, let me go
[00:49.21]I will let you down, let me go
[00:55.08]Even if your heart can't take it light me up in flames
[01:00.96]Light me up in
[01:05.13]
[01:05.13]Light me up, oh
[01:07.70]Light me up, oh
[01:10.98]Light me up, oh
[01:14.64]
[01:14.64]You better run from me
[01:17.24]You better say goodbye
[01:20.03]And even if I plead
[01:23.44]Don't waste your time
[01:24.90]'Cause I'm a broken home
[01:29.38]You're better off alone
[01:32.66]You better run from me
[01:35.61]Before I take your soul
[01:39.23]
[01:39.23]If I go, let me go
[01:45.50]Don't you follow me, let me go
[01:51.97]I will let you down, let me go
[01:58.09]Even if your heart can't take it light me up in flames
[02:03.92]Light me up in
[02:07.97]
[02:07.97]Light me up, oh
[02:10.90]Light me up, oh
[02:14.08]Light me up, oh
[02:16.83]Light me up in flames, oh
[02:19.04]Light me up, oh
[02:23.13]Light me up, oh
[02:26.85]Light me up, oh
[02:29.38]Light me up in flames
