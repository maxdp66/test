[00:07.32]A feeling for you keeps on growing
[00:11.13]I can feel it flowing all of the time
[00:15.34]Time is the essence of destiny
[00:18.57]Of the things that are in your mind
[00:22.89]
[00:22.89]Problems we had are all solved now
[00:26.59]Whether it's good or bad
[00:30.34]Now as I turn to you girl
[00:33.70]Would it matter whatever we have
[00:38.15]
[00:38.15]You are the reason I'm living
[00:41.87]The reason for whatever I do
[00:45.38]And no one would have told me
[00:48.79]That you girl didn't even love me
[00:53.28]
[00:53.28]Try to protect you and keep you
[00:56.93]Give you a place in life
[01:00.48]Better than the bottom of a can
[01:08.14]
[01:08.14]Wouldn't it make you so happy
[01:11.76]If you didn't have to love me again
[01:15.78]No one else could look after you
[01:19.38]No longer lovers just friends
[01:23.75]There's nothing else to discover
[01:27.12]We made a mistake now we're through
[01:30.90]It's just a rearrangement of you
[02:01.54]
[02:01.54]Now I'm turning to you girl
[02:05.29]To find out what else we could do
[02:08.94]That hasn't been done already
[02:12.30]There's so many parts to you
[02:16.81]
[02:16.81]Pretty girl can't you realize?
[02:20.46]How could you not love what's yours
[02:24.30]
[02:24.30]Even if you're crazy
[02:27.58]Was a reason I still love you and need you
[02:32.21]You are my reason for living
[02:35.52]The reason for whatever I do
[02:40.04]
[02:40.04]Nothing can take the place of you
