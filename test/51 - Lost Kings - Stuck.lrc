[00:09.59]Just because I can't put my finger on the problem
[00:14.24]Doesn't mean there ain't a problem
[00:18.42]We're so quick to think history could just solve 'em
[00:22.84]Don't you think we would've solved them by now?
[00:27.11]I gave you what you wanted
[00:29.41]Moved East right after college
[00:31.56]But nothing filled the space
[00:35.91]I called you heavy hearted
[00:38.45]Moved West the end of August
[00:40.59]So I could find a place
[00:44.18]
[00:44.18]But maybe I need ya
[00:46.34]'Cause it's harder than I thought
[00:49.09]Maybe I need ya
[00:51.45]But you always want too much
[00:53.44]Oh, fuck it, I need ya
[00:55.84]And I'm really tryna not
[00:58.18]But I miss it when it stops, I
[01:05.49]
[01:05.49]I'm somewhere between love
[01:07.75]I got feelings I don't trust
[01:12.32]I'm right in between love
[01:17.15]I'm stuck
[01:22.44]
[01:22.44]I get so possessive when I see you happy
[01:27.25]But I want you to be happy
[01:31.79]I get so conflicted when I see you without me
[01:35.96]Are you better off without me?
[01:39.05]Don't you know, you gave me what I wanted
[01:42.63]So quiet in the morning
[01:44.73]Just you and I could fill the space
[01:49.05]Lately I start to notice
[01:51.41]I've been missing all the little moments
[01:53.80]By now I thought I'd be okay
[01:57.40]But maybe I need ya
[01:59.97]'Cause it's harder than I thought
[02:02.05]Maybe I need ya
[02:04.35]But you always want too much
[02:06.60]Oh, fuck it, I need ya
[02:08.98]And I'm really tryna not
[02:11.07]But I miss it when it stops, I
[02:16.15]
[02:16.15]I'm somewhere between love
[02:20.86]I got feelings I don't trust
[02:25.00]I'm right in between love
[02:29.83]I'm stuck
[02:34.10]
[02:34.10]Stuck inside this feeling, baby
[02:36.71]Stuck inside this love
[02:39.06]Stuck inside a moment, baby
[02:41.23]Can we give it up?
[02:43.30]Stuck inside this feeling, baby
[02:45.75]Stuck inside this love
[02:47.93]Stuck inside a moment, baby
[02:50.12]Can we give it up?
[02:52.36]
[02:52.36]I'm somewhere between love
[02:57.28]I got feelings I don't trust
[03:01.83]I'm right in between love
[03:06.56]I'm stuck
