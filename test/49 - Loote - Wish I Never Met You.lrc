[00:08.18]That your friends introduced me to you
[00:10.37]Fucked me up
[00:12.52]We got high at the bar
[00:14.04]Now the bar's so high
[00:16.42]Girl, on the night we met in the city
[00:19.39]I should've just got drunk and stayed home
[00:22.29]But now I got a piece of you with me wherever I go
[00:26.94]I'm still alone
[00:28.13]
[00:28.13]Thinking oh-na-na, eh-na-na
[00:31.60]Dammit, I wish I never met you

[01:17.53]And a ghost in my brain won't let me shake it
[01:21.74]I keep run, running into your girlfriends
[01:24.38]And they knew me back, back
[01:25.86]Back to the night we met in the city
[01:28.72]I should've just got drunk and stayed home
