[00:00.00]Can I tell you something just between you and me?
[00:04.96]When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
[00:09.69]Every single word is perfect as it can be
[00:14.37]And I need you here with me

[00:44.85]There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
[00:49.59]Now I know I'm falling in deep
[00:52.80]'Cause I need you here with me

[01:21.66]I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
[01:26.38]Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
[01:31.01]'Cause I need you here with me
[01:34.63]
