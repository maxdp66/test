[00:09.61]Alright, alright, okay, ah, alright, okay
[00:15.84]Alright, okay
[00:17.44]
[00:17.44]Return of the Mack', get up, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
[00:22.59]Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
[00:24.11]Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit
[00:25.53]We get up, fresh out, pimp strut walking
[00:27.50]Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
[00:29.09]Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, sweater game
[00:31.33]Nope, nope, y'all can't copy that
[00:32.73]Bad, moonwalkin', this here, is our party
[00:35.84]My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way, grown music
[00:40.26]I shed my skin and put my bones into everything, I record to it
[00:44.04]And yet I'm on, let that stage light go and shine on down
[00:48.15]Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
[00:51.63]Money
[00:52.44]Stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
[00:55.00]But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
[00:57.45]Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustling
[01:02.86]Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
[01:04.58]With the fourtrack, bussin'
[01:06.72]Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit
[01:10.17]Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
[01:13.88]We give that to the people, spread it across the country
[01:17.56]Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
[01:20.63]We give it to the people, spread it across the country
[01:23.95]
[01:23.95]Can we go back, this is the moment
[01:26.99]Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
[01:30.13]So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
[01:33.42]Like the ceiling can't hold us
[01:37.15]
[01:37.15]Can we go back, this is the moment
[01:40.00]Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
[01:43.12]So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
[01:46.52]Like the ceiling can't hold us
[01:50.42]
[01:50.42]Now, can I kick it? Thank you
[01:52.87]Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
[01:54.62]I grew up really wanting gold fronts
[01:56.00]But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
[01:57.91]Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I've got an 808 in my heart beat
[02:01.00]And I'm meeting at the beat like you gave a little speed
[02:03.07]To a great white shark on shark week, raw
[02:04.69]Tell me go up, gone
[02:05.85]Gone! Deuces, goodbye, I've got a world to see
[02:07.96]And my girl, she wanna see Rome
[02:09.44]Caesar make you a believer, nah
[02:11.36]I never ever did it for a throne
[02:12.71]That validation comes, so I'm giving it back to the people now
[02:15.35]Sing that song and it goes like
[02:17.25]
[02:17.25]Raise those hands, this is our party
[02:20.60]We came here to live life like nobody was watching
[02:23.65]I got my city right behind me
[02:25.68]If I fall they got me
[02:26.66]Learn from that failure, gain humility
[02:28.81]And then we keep marching, I said
[02:30.00]
[02:30.00]Can we go back, this is the moment
[02:32.42]Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
[02:35.60]So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
[02:39.18]Like the ceiling can't hold us
[02:43.09]
[02:43.09]Can we go back, this is the moment
[02:45.99]Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
[02:48.99]So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
[02:52.55]Like the ceiling can't hold us
[03:02.00]
[03:02.00]So we put our hands up
[03:13.86]So we put our hands up
[03:22.13]

[03:54.70]So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
