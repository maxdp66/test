[00:28.63]I am floating out to sea
[00:34.00]Time will take it all from me
[00:41.98]Don't know where the wind will take me now
[00:48.15]But we'll see
[00:51.77]But we'll see
[00:57.00]I am searching endlessly
[01:03.65]Am I where I want to be?
[01:11.07]Don't know where this road will take me now
[01:16.99]But we'll see
[01:20.00]But we'll see
[01:23.00]
[01:23.00]I guess we will see
[01:30.08]I guess we will see
[01:37.06]Won't you show me?
[01:44.14]Won't you show me?
[01:51.70]Won't you show me?
[02:51.00]
[02:51.00]Close my eyes so I can see
[02:57.98]All these lights are blinding me
[03:04.88]Don't know where my mind will take me now
[03:10.07]But we'll see
[03:13.15]But we'll see
[03:19.70]All this longing to be free
[03:25.60]What if I could let it be
[03:32.81]Don't know when I'll ever find out how
[03:38.80]But we'll see
[03:41.03]But we'll see
[03:44.96]
[03:44.96]I guess we will see
[03:52.06]I guess we will see
[03:53.97]Won't you show me?
[04:06.90]Won't you show me?
[04:13.44]Won't you show me?
[04:42.89]
[04:42.89]Won't you show me?
[05:12.89]I am floating out to sea
[05:20.11]Time will take it all from me
[05:26.89]Don't know where the wind will take me now
[05:32.00]But we'll see
