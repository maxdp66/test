[00:13.69]You're a world away
[00:17.09]Somewhere in the crowd
[00:20.17]In a foreign place
[00:22.91]Are you happy now?
[00:26.07]There's nothing left to say
[00:28.66]So I shut my mouth
[00:31.74]So won't you tell me, babe
[00:34.71]Are you happy now?
[00:38.15]
[00:38.15]You're the only one who can up and run
[00:40.79]Leave me just as empty as the day you came
[00:43.34]And you hold all the cards, all the broken hearts
[00:46.13]Strung over your shoulder till it's all in vain
[00:49.06]
[00:49.06]And only you know the strength of your teeth
[00:52.06]The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep
[00:58.11]And lonely
[01:01.11]
[01:01.11]You're a world away
[01:04.13]Somewhere in the crowd
[01:07.11]In a foreign place
[01:10.44]Are you happy now?
[01:13.37]There's nothing left to say
[01:16.06]So I shut my mouth
[01:19.03]So won't you tell me, babe
[01:22.21]Are you happy now?
[01:25.00]Are you happy now?
[01:33.05]
[01:33.05]You're the only one who can
[01:40.00]
[01:40.00]In the palm of your hands
[01:41.48]You can make me dance
[01:42.86]Spin me around in circles till I'm wrapped in string
[01:45.59]You keep on talking sweet till your fingers bleed
[01:48.69]But don't you dare ask me how I've been
[01:51.64]
[01:51.64]Now only you know the strength of your teeth
[01:54.09]The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep
[02:00.07]And lonely
[02:03.79]
[02:03.79]You're a world away
[02:05.97]Somewhere in the crowd
[02:09.00]In a foreign place
[02:12.13]Are you happy now?
[02:15.21]There's nothing left to say
[02:17.98]So I shut my mouth
[02:21.20]So won't you tell me, babe
[02:24.39]Are you happy now?
[02:27.26]Are you happy now?
[02:35.43]
[02:35.43]You're the only one who can
[02:41.75]You're the only, you're the only
[02:47.43]You're the only one who can
[02:53.61]You're the only, you're the only
[02:55.05]
[02:55.05]World away
[02:57.09]Somewhere in the crowd
[03:00.21]In a foreign place
[03:02.75]Are you happy now?
[03:05.48]There's nothing left to say
[03:08.44]So I shut my mouth
[03:11.93]So won't you tell me, babe
[03:15.00]Are you happy now?
