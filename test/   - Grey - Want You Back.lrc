[00:11.50]Like a coat that I sold in the summer
[00:13.59]Now I'm cold, and I want you back
[00:16.93]Want you back
[00:22.10]Like an old baby doll that some other kid stole
[00:24.61]I want you back
[00:27.29]Want you back
[00:30.33]
[00:30.33]Digging out your old letters
[00:32.93]Sleeping in your old sweater
[00:35.48]Guess I should've known better
[00:38.01]'Cause you're gone, I want, I want, I want you
[00:41.35]
[00:41.35]Riding in your front seat
[00:42.87]Telling me you want me
[00:44.19]Nothing could assure your love like this
[00:47.65]Until I did
[00:51.72]Running all the the red lights
[00:53.08]Making up a good life
[00:54.31]Couldn't we go back to what we had?
[00:58.20]Just like that
[01:00.43]'Cause I want you back
[01:03.01]
[01:03.01]Like a float in the ocean
[01:04.64]Our woodwork broke, but I want you back
[01:08.44]Want you back
[01:12.76]Like a kiss on the face that the rain washed away
[01:16.08]I want you back
[01:18.60]Want you back, mm
[01:21.98]
[01:21.98]Digging out your old letters
[01:24.68]Sleeping in your old sweater
[01:27.20]Guess I should've known better
[01:29.49]'Cause you're gone, I want, I want, I want you
[01:32.98]
[01:32.98]Riding in your front seat
[01:34.37]Telling me you want me
[01:35.66]Nothing could assure your love like this
[01:39.25]Until I did
[01:42.54]Running all the the red lights
[01:44.68]Making up a good life
[01:46.02]Couldn't we go back to what we had?
[01:49.89]Just like that
[01:52.08]'Cause I want you back
[02:03.00]
[02:03.00]Digging out your old letters
[02:05.96]Sleeping in your old sweater
[02:08.52]Guess I should've known better
[02:10.82]'Cause you're gone, I want, I want, I want you
[02:14.25]
[02:14.25]Riding in your front seat
[02:15.67]Telling me you want me
[02:16.97]Nothing could assure your love like this
[02:20.43]Until I did
[02:23.86]Running all the the red lights
[02:26.05]Making up a good life
[02:27.28]Couldn't we go back to what we had?
[02:30.92]Just like that
[02:33.46]'Cause I want you back
[02:34.88]
[02:34.88]Now I know, now I know
[02:37.43]Now I got you in my head
[02:40.06]Now I know, now I know
[02:41.89]You're gone, I want, I want, I want you
[02:45.25]
[02:45.25]Running all the the red lights
[02:46.84]Making up a good life
[02:47.86]Couldn't we go back to what we had?
[02:51.71]Just like that
[02:53.90]'Cause I want you back
