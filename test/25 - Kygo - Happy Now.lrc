[00:08.80]We don't wanna believe it, that it's all gone
[00:12.96]It's just a matter of minutes, before the sun goes down
[00:17.14]We're afraid to admit it
[00:18.24]But I know you know, know that
[00:24.87]We should've known better, but kept on trying
[00:29.09]It's time that we see it, the fire's dying out
[00:33.38]Can't believe that I see this, we're out of chances now
[00:37.49]And I just want you to know that
[00:40.62]
[00:40.62]You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
[00:45.26]And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
[00:49.12]Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
[00:53.16]So I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now
[00:57.24]You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
[01:01.26]And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
[01:05.23]Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
[01:09.58]So I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now
[01:15.03]
[01:15.03]I hope you'll be happy now
[01:18.63]Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
[01:23.14]I hope you'll be happy now
[01:26.20]Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now

[01:42.90]Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
[01:59.64]I hope you'll be happy now
[02:04.81]
[02:04.81]I thought we would make it
[02:06.12]If I just held on
[02:08.77]But it's really crazy
[02:09.82]How love could fade so fast
[02:12.95]We said, "Forever"
[02:13.91]But now we're in the past
[02:17.63]And I just want you to know that
[02:20.66]
[02:20.66]You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
[02:24.68]And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
[02:28.75]Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
[02:32.77]So I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now
[02:36.98]You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
[02:40.93]And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
[02:45.03]Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
[02:48.97]So I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now
[03:10.00]
[03:10.00]Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
[03:14.42]I hope you'll be happy now
[03:18.45]I hope you'll be happy now
[03:22.50]I hope you'll be happy now
