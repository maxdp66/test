[00:00.00]This is war that I'm living in
[00:03.17]Stranger than the one before
[00:05.73]I don't wanna fight it anymore
[00:10.38]There's a meaning I've been looking for
[00:13.65]I never had to go too far
[00:16.07]Found you in my heart down on the floor
[00:23.53]
[00:23.53]Take me back to the start
[00:27.64]Before all the scars affected me
[00:33.61]Take me back to the start
[00:37.83]Before I was worried about everything
[00:44.00]
[00:44.00]Take me, take me
[00:51.12]I just wanna live in your arms
[00:54.21]Where I'm safe forever
[00:59.14]Keep me safe forever
[01:09.55]Keep me safe forever
[01:23.02]
[01:23.02]What's this feeling that I'm feeling?
[01:25.51]All different than the times before
[01:28.53]I can't even fake it anymore
[01:33.15]I was shielded by my own mistakes
[01:36.22]So scared to give my God a break
[01:38.77]Ready to let you love me now
[01:45.77]
[01:45.77]Take me back to the start
[01:50.16]Before all the scars affected me
[01:56.36]Take me back to the start
[02:00.35]Before I was worried about everything
[02:06.61]
[02:06.61]Take me, take me
[02:13.94]I just wanna live in your arms
[02:16.63]Where I'm safe forever
[02:21.88]Keep me safe forever
[02:32.19]Keep me safe forever
[02:52.75]
[02:52.75]Keep me safe forever
[03:02.93]Keep me safe forever
