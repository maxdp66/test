[00:07.72]I can't get down
[00:11.58]Down from this high
[00:15.31]High as a waterfall
[00:19.42]If hearts could fly
[00:23.12]Want you to breathe
[00:26.60]Breathe next to me
[00:30.32]Caught in this lullaby
[00:34.26]Sing it to me
[00:37.00]
[00:37.00]I wanna drown in your holy water
[00:40.84]You know a sin never felt so good
[00:44.19]I wanna drown in your holy water
[00:48.05]A-amen (a-amen, a-amen)
[00:59.56]I wanna drown in your holy water
[01:05.36]You know a sin never felt so—
[01:23.79]
[01:23.79]I'm all shook up
[01:27.74]Shook up on you
[01:31.28]We burn like fireflies
[01:35.14]Burn baby blue
[01:38.87]'Cause I'm so deep
[01:42.74]Deep into you
[01:46.51]You are my church tonight
[01:50.30]My holy view
[01:53.00]
[01:53.00]I wanna drown in your holy water
[01:56.60]You know a sin never felt so good
[02:00.30]I wanna drown in your holy water
[02:04.22]A-amen (a-amen, a-amen)
[02:08.26]I wanna drown in your holy water
[02:11.87]You know a sin never felt so good
[02:15.35]I wanna drown in your holy water
[02:19.02]A-amen
[02:21.33]You know a sin never felt so—
[02:47.89]
[02:47.89](You know a sin never felt so good)
