[00:07.11]Come here, darling, think it's time
[00:10.73]Let you heart open up
[00:15.03]Cheers to love, broken wild
[00:18.83]Leaving you lost and scarred
[00:23.05]You've been lonely just like me
[00:26.77]And chose nothing but a dream
[00:30.72]Come here, darling, take my hand
[00:34.64]We'll pull through, you and me
[00:39.17]
[00:39.17]'Cause two hearts are better than one
[00:41.96]Pull me closer
[00:43.57]Hold me like we're gonna die young
[00:46.11]It's almost over
[00:47.61]Kiss me now before we say goodbye
[00:51.13]Two hearts are better than one
[00:54.05]Two hearts are better than one
[01:11.10]
[01:11.10]Future's lost, so it seems
[01:14.78]Only now carries me
[01:18.92]Past is gone with the wind
[01:22.46]Like unkept promises
[01:26.43]But we still got tonight
[01:30.74]'Til the light breaks us up
[01:34.76]Come here, darling, let's stay out
[01:38.73]'Til the morning, you and I
[01:43.30]
[01:43.30]'Cause two hearts are better than one
[01:45.70]Pull me closer
[01:47.48]Hold me like we're gonna die young
[01:49.37]It's almost over
[01:51.49]Kiss me now before we say goodbye
[01:54.92]Two hearts are better than one
[01:57.62]Two hearts are better than one
[02:15.35]
[02:15.35]'Cause two hearts are better than one
[02:17.88]Pull me closer
[02:19.55]Hold me like we're gonna die young
[02:21.76]It's almost over
[02:23.28]Kiss me now before we say goodbye
[02:26.99]'Cause two hearts are better than one
[02:29.38]Two hearts are better than one
[02:37.66]
[02:37.66]Two hearts are better than one
[02:46.88]
[02:46.88]'Cause two hearts are better than one
[02:49.62]Pull me closer
[02:51.33]Hold me like we're gonna die young
[02:53.52]It's almost over
[02:55.29]Kiss me now before we say goodbye
[02:58.80]Two hearts are better than one
[03:01.53]Two hearts are better than one
