[00:05.46]Uh
[00:08.08]Yeah, yeah
[00:11.05]
[00:11.05]When I was young, I fell in love
[00:12.97]We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)
[00:16.21]Then we grew up, started to touch
[00:18.23]Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)
[00:21.38]Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much
[00:23.72]And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
[00:26.30]Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
[00:31.00]
[00:31.00]She used to meet me on the Eastside
[00:32.87]In the city where the sun don't set
[00:35.07]And every day you know that we ride
[00:37.84]Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette
[00:40.39]Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
[00:44.29]We can go anywhere we want
[00:46.85]Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
[00:49.63]Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
[00:52.99]
[00:52.99]We can do anything if we put our minds to it
[00:56.29]Take your whole life then you put a line through it
[00:58.92]My love is yours if you're willing to take it
[01:01.04]Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
[01:03.71]So come away, starting today
[01:06.18]Start a new life, together in a different place
[01:08.91]We know that love is how these ideas came to be
[01:11.52]So baby, run away, away with me
[01:14.56]
[01:14.56]Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
[01:17.76]A house and everything in between
[01:19.62]And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
[01:22.29]Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
[01:24.89]We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
[01:27.76]Have old friends and know our enemies
[01:30.23]Now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
[01:32.88]Back to the day when I was falling in love
[01:34.92]
[01:34.92]He used to meet me on the Eastside
[01:36.37]In the city where the sun don't set
[01:38.65]And every day you know where we ride
[01:41.66]Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
[01:44.27]And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
[01:48.14]We can go anywhere we want
[01:50.59]Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
[01:53.32]Just take my hand and come with me
[01:55.98]Singing
[01:56.94]
[01:56.94]We can do anything if we put our minds to it
[01:59.99]Take your whole life then you put a line through it
[02:02.52]My love is yours if you're willing to take it
[02:04.84]Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
[02:07.50]So come away, starting today
[02:09.89]Start a new life, together in a different place
[02:12.33]We know that love is how these ideas came to be
[02:15.01]So baby, run away with me
[02:18.07]
[02:18.07]Run away, now
[02:19.92]Run away, now
[02:20.86]Run away, now
[02:22.07]Run away, now
[02:24.81]Run away, now

[02:29.76]
[02:29.76]She used to meet me on the Eastside
[02:37.52]
[02:37.52]He used to meet me on the Eastside
[02:42.80]
[02:42.80]She used to meet me on the Eastside
[02:45.67]In the city where the sun don't set
