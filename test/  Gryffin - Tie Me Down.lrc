[00:09.63]Don't lie, I know you've been thinking it
[00:14.00]And two times, you let it slip from your lips
[00:18.72]You've got too much pride to make any promises
[00:23.40]Thinking that we got time, and you want to keep it in
[00:28.74]
[00:28.74]I want you out in the pouring rain
[00:31.16]I want you down on your knees
[00:33.52]Prayin' to God that I feel the same
[00:35.91]I'm right here, baby, so please
[00:38.43]
[00:38.43]Hold me up, tie me down
[00:40.83]'Cause I never wanna leave your side
[00:43.19]Swear to never let you down
[00:45.73]And it's been eatin' me alive
[00:48.07]You can take me home
[00:50.10]You can never let me go
[00:53.24]Hold me up, hold me up
[00:56.46]
[00:56.46]And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
[01:01.27]And tie me, tie me down, down
[01:06.08]And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
[01:11.05]And tie me, tie me down, down
[01:16.95]
[01:16.95]Nine lives until you fall at my feet
[01:22.47]Don't hide, you're wasting your energy
[01:26.62]You're not shy, so baby, it's useless
[01:31.37]So don't try, 'cause you'll end up losin' it
[01:36.31]
[01:36.31]I want you out in the pouring rain
[01:39.07]I want you down on your knees
[01:41.24]Prayin' to God that I feel the same
[01:43.63]I'm right here, baby, so please
[01:46.09]
[01:46.09]Hold me up, tie me down
[01:48.76]'Cause I never wanna leave your side
[01:51.02]Swear to never let you down
[01:53.51]And it's been eatin' me alive
[01:55.88]You can take me home
[01:57.86]You can never let me go
[02:00.91]Hold me up, hold me up
[02:04.21]
[02:04.21]And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
[02:09.22]And tie me, tie me down, down
[02:14.02]And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
[02:18.92]And tie me, tie me down, down
[02:24.22]
[02:24.22]So wrap your arms around my chest
[02:28.91]And I'll put my hands around your neck
[02:34.43]'Cause nobody wins these waiting games
[02:37.00]You push and you pull, but you should stay
[02:41.26]Stay
[02:44.24]
[02:44.24]Hold me up, tie me down
[02:47.00]'Cause I never wanna leave your side
[02:49.18]Swear to never let you down
[02:51.40]And it's been eatin' me alive
[02:53.78]You can take me home
[02:55.81]You can never let me go
[02:58.86]Hold me up, hold me up
[03:02.27]
[03:02.27]And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
[03:07.16]And tie me, tie me down, down
[03:12.00]And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
[03:16.93]And tie me, tie me down, down
[03:21.80]
[03:21.80]Down, down
