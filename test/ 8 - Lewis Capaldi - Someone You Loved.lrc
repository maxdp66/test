[00:09.18]I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
[00:17.87]This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
[00:24.43]I need somebody to heal
[00:27.23]Somebody to know
[00:29.30]Somebody to have
[00:31.42]Somebody to hold
[00:33.71]It's easy to say
[00:35.88]But it's never the same
[00:38.12]I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
[00:42.13]
[00:42.13]Now the day bleeds
[00:44.38]Into nightfall
[00:46.58]And you're not here
[00:48.48]To get me through it all
[00:50.71]I let my guard down
[00:52.88]And then you pulled the rug
[00:55.25]I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[01:01.54]
[01:01.54]I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
[01:10.21]This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
[01:16.79]Now, I need somebody to know
[01:19.61]Somebody to heal
[01:21.71]Somebody to have
[01:23.68]Just to know how it feels
[01:26.10]It's easy to say but it's never the same
[01:30.48]I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
[01:34.57]
[01:34.57]Now the day bleeds
[01:36.76]Into nightfall
[01:38.92]And you're not here
[01:40.84]To get me through it all
[01:42.99]I let my guard down
[01:45.25]And then you pulled the rug
[01:47.65]I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[01:53.33]
[01:53.33]And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
[01:59.73]I fall into your arms
[02:03.76]I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
[02:09.22]
[02:09.22]For now the day bleeds
[02:11.68]Into nightfall
[02:13.84]And you're not here
[02:15.69]To get me through it all
[02:17.96]I let my guard down
[02:20.12]And then you pulled the rug
[02:22.56]I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[02:26.69]
[02:26.69]But now the day bleeds
[02:29.05]Into nightfall
[02:31.32]And you're not here
[02:33.18]To get me through it all
[02:35.40]I let my guard down
[02:37.77]And then you pulled the rug
[02:40.07]I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[02:44.14]
[02:44.14]I let my guard down
[02:46.36]And then you pulled the rug
[02:48.79]I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
