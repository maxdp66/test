[00:07.49]We were in love with the sun
[00:12.01]We were in love with the sun, sippin' on coke and rum
[00:15.69]Way head up in the clouds but when I look back now
[00:19.55]Ain't nothing else I would do
[00:23.65]When I spend the summer on you
[00:25.48]
[00:25.48]Our troubles all under rocks
[00:29.35]Our troubles all under rocks, filling our plastic cups
[00:33.36]Don't bother if inside we spend those long hot nights
[00:37.48]Until the sky turned blue
[00:41.26]When I spend the summer on you
[00:49.49]
[00:49.49]I spend the summer on you
[00:59.17]When I spend the summer on you
[01:03.09]
[01:03.09]Most things in life ain't free
[01:06.89]Most things in life ain't free but you were all that I need
[01:10.87]My feet down in the sand, you take the watch from my hand
[01:14.87]And said, "It's no more use"
[01:18.72]When I spend the summer on you
[01:20.80]
[01:20.80]We were in love with the sun
[01:24.60]We were in love with the sun, sippin' a coke and rum
[01:28.65]You asked me, "Are you sure? 'Cause I can not be returned"
[01:33.01]And so I make my move
[01:36.70]When I spend the summer on you
[01:44.62]
[01:44.62]When I spend the summer on you
[01:54.60]
[01:54.60]And when I look back on those days
[01:58.58]There's not a thing that I would change
[02:02.21]So when the year is through
[02:04.58]I'll be right here to spend the summer on you
[02:22.32]
[02:22.32]When I spend the summer on you
[02:31.66]When I spend the summer on you
