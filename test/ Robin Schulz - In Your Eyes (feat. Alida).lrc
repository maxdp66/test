[00:09.07]Hearing whispers in the night
[00:10.97]Voices filling up your mind
[00:13.94]You're like a ghost of you
[00:16.94]You've been drowning in the rain
[00:19.10]Slowly saving up the pain
[00:21.10]So deep inside of you
[00:24.00]
[00:24.00]See the colors of the sky
[00:26.08]Slowly turn from black and white
[00:28.03]A rising hope, bright as gold
[00:31.72]And now there's nothing left to lose
[00:34.05]So we're breaking all the rules
[00:35.93]And they don't know what we know
[00:39.81]
[00:39.81]'Cause I can hear the thunder from afar
[00:43.40]A lightning in the dark
[00:46.35]I can feel a fire come alive
[00:49.59]So calm before the storm
[00:51.39]So dark before the dawn
[00:54.35]
[00:54.35]Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
[00:59.99]In your eyes (oh)
[01:02.19]Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
[01:08.24]In your eyes (oh)
[01:10.39]Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes
[01:26.45]Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes
[01:29.28]
[01:29.28]Now you'll never be the same
[01:31.30]Once you felt that burning flame
[01:33.71]You're chasing stars alive
[01:36.84]What was broken's left behind
[01:39.06]Watch it crumble in the light
[01:41.67]Nothing can stop you now
[01:44.12]
[01:44.12]See the colors of the sky
[01:45.92]Slowly turn from black and white
[01:47.85]A rising hope, bright as gold
[01:51.97]And now there's nothing left to lose
[01:53.81]So we're breaking all the rules
[01:55.89]And they don't know what we know, whoa
[02:00.00]
[02:00.00]'Cause I can hear the thunder from afar
[02:02.94]A lightning in the dark
[02:05.98]I can feel a fire come alive
[02:09.14]So calm before the storm
[02:11.07]So dark before the dawn
[02:14.56]
[02:14.56]Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
[02:20.31]In your eyes (oh)
[02:22.38]Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
[02:28.08]In your eyes
[02:30.48]Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes
[02:46.50]Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
[02:55.73]Eh-yeah (oh)
[03:02.33]
[03:02.33]Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
[03:08.10](In your eyes) (oh)
[03:09.85]Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes (oh)
[03:16.00](In your eyes)
[03:18.30]Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes
