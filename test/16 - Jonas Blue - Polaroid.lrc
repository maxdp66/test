[00:07.00]Let me tell you how it happened
[00:11.21]I wasn't looking for someone that night
[00:15.47]No, I was never a believer
[00:19.50]But you could fall in love with the first sight
[00:24.02]
[00:24.02]But all of a sudden
[00:24.99]We loved and got lost in the moment
[00:27.93]All of a sudden
[00:29.00]She's gone in the flash of a light
[00:32.04]I never was looking, hmm
[00:34.32]I'll be looking for the rest of my life
[00:42.04]
[00:42.04]We took a Polaroid
[00:44.18]You signed your name up on it
[00:45.91]I put it in my wallet
[00:47.70]Hoping I'd see your face again
[00:50.50]We took a Polaroid
[00:52.19]Captured the look in your eyes
[00:54.40]It's only a matter of time
[00:56.37]Before it starts fading
[01:05.59]
[01:05.59]Was it my imagination?
[01:10.07]I could've swore I saw someone like you
[01:13.93]A thousand people at the station
[01:18.60]And it's like I used to doubt of you
[01:22.08]
[01:22.08]Then all of a sudden
[01:23.83]I loved and got lost in the moment
[01:27.08]All of a sudden
[01:28.60]She's gone in the flick of a light
[01:31.00]I never was looking, hmm
[01:33.14]I've been looking for the rest of my life
[01:40.48]
[01:40.48]We took a Polaroid
[01:42.48]You signed your name up on it
[01:44.43]I put it in my wallet
[01:46.55]Hoping I'll see your face again
[01:49.04]We took a Polaroid
[01:50.82]Captured the look in your eyes
[01:53.01]It's only a matter of time
[01:54.76]Before it starts fadin'
[02:05.11]
[02:05.11]We were dancing without moving
[02:08.85]All my friends are leaving me behind
[02:12.49]I didn't wanna catch a feeling
[02:16.67]There was something in the flashin' light
[02:20.57]
[02:20.57]Then all of a sudden
[02:23.10]I loved and got lost in the moment
[02:26.10]All of a sudden
[02:27.43]She's gone in the flick of a light
[02:30.31]I never was looking, hmm
[02:34.61]I've been looking for the rest of my life
[02:37.99]
[02:37.99]We took a Polaroid
[02:41.56]You signed your name up on it
[02:43.50]I put it in my wallet
[02:45.64]Hoping I'd see your face again
[02:48.01]We took a Polaroid
[02:49.81]Captured the look in your eyes
[02:52.00]It's only a matter of time
[02:53.87]Before it starts fading
[02:56.12]
[02:56.12]We took a Polaroid
[02:58.41]You signed your name up on it
