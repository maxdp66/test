[00:15.17]Hey, how are you doing?
[00:20.66]I just wanted to say that I miss you, I guess
[00:23.05]And I'm sorry
[00:25.43]Call me back
[00:27.62]Bye
[00:49.74]
[00:49.74]So tell me how I'm supposed to feel now
[00:53.52]60 over the limit just 'cause I can
[00:56.78]They say, "You know, you gotta slow down
[00:59.80]There's no coming back"
[01:02.35]So young and restless, I'm a clich√©, yeah
[01:06.08]But it's easier said than done
[01:08.84]
[01:08.84]And I can't keep waiting here
[01:11.33]I'm just aging
[01:12.76]So I'm gone
[01:14.26]Such a shame, and
[01:15.58]
[01:15.58]Baby, I'm leaving
[01:19.03]Before tomorrow comes
[01:22.64]I don't believe in saying "I'm never coming home"
[01:29.62]But I'm drawing the line
[01:33.09]And say whatever you like
[01:36.76]But I'm leaving
[01:40.14]I'm letting go of all I've ever known
[02:18.50]
[02:18.50]So falling in and falling out fast
[02:22.03]I'm burning up, I can't believe this got old so fast
[02:26.00]And I'm done with feeling like I'm told I should
[02:31.12]'Cause it's a feeling I'm chasing
[02:34.46]And I ain't found it here in a while
[02:37.59]
[02:37.59]But I can't keep waiting here
[02:39.94]I'm just aging
[02:41.45]So I'm gone
[02:42.95]Such a shame
[02:44.66]
[02:44.66]Baby, I'm leaving
[02:48.15]Before tomorrow comes
[02:51.09]I don't believe in saying "I'm never coming home"
[02:58.50]But I'm drawing the line
[03:01.67]And say whatever you like
[03:04.82]But I'm leaving
[03:09.57]I'm letting go of all I've ever known
[03:16.01]
[03:16.01]('Cause I'm leaving)
[03:24.54]('Cause I'm leaving)
[03:30.03]('Cause I'm leaving)
[03:33.10]('Cause I'm leaving)
