[00:09.00]We haven't talked all morning
[00:11.12]Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
[00:14.00]I'm scared, I'm falling
[00:15.99]Losing all, losing all my control
[00:19.11]And I'm tired of talking
[00:21.49]Feel myself saying the same old things
[00:23.80]But this love's important
[00:25.78]Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way
[00:29.02]
[00:29.02]I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
[00:31.42]Feel like we about to break up
[00:33.62]I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
[00:36.31]Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

[01:08.75]못 떠나고 뭘 하고 있는 건지
[01:12.23]언젠가는 다 끝날 걸
[01:14.69]떠날 걸 알지만
[01:16.53]고장 난 우릴
[01:18.80]다시 고쳐 볼 수는 없을지
[01:21.22]아무런 말도 넌 하지 마
[01:24.19]마지막은 없어
[01:26.49]
[01:26.49]I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
[01:28.87]Feel like we about to break up

[02:08.77]So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
[02:11.88]Work this whole thing out
[02:13.70]날 첨 만났던, 설레던 순간 그때처럼
[02:18.36]So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
