[00:01.09]I'm not over all the messed up shit you said
[00:05.34]I forgive you, but it's not easy to forget
[00:10.14]Eventually I'll find a place to lock these hard feelings away
[00:14.80]Eventually, but not right now
[00:19.59]
[00:19.59]I was gonna let it slide
[00:21.74]'Til you went and fooled me twice
[00:24.41]Man, I really hope in time
[00:26.77]I view you like I used to
[00:29.26]I was gonna let it slide
[00:31.68]'Til you went and fooled me twice
[00:34.14]Man, I really hope in time
[00:36.45]I view you like I used to
[00:39.00]
[00:39.00]One day, I'll look at you through
[00:42.19]Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
[00:49.03]One day I'll look at you through
[00:51.62]Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
[00:57.68]But not right now
[01:07.96]
[01:07.96]When we're older I'll let you chalk it up to youth
[01:12.27]When I'm colder and you don't trigger my short fuse
[01:17.13]Eventually I'll find a place in my heart to give you grace
[01:21.85]Eventually, but not right now
[01:26.51]
[01:26.51]One day I'll look at you through
[01:29.72]Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
[01:36.93]One day I'll look at you through
[01:39.25]Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
[01:45.06]But not right now
[01:55.76]One day I'll look at you through
[01:58.61]Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
[02:04.35]But not right now
[02:23.89]
[02:23.89]I was gonna let it slide
[02:26.65]'Til you went and fooled me twice
[02:28.84]Man, I really hope in time
[02:31.35]I view you like I used to
[02:33.63]I was gonna let it slide
[02:36.08]'Til you went and fooled me twice
[02:38.63]Man, I really hope in time
[02:40.74]I view you like I used to
[02:43.52]
[02:43.52]One day I'll look at you through
[02:46.42]Look at you through kinder eyes, kinder eyes
[02:51.76]But not right now
