[00:02.88]I fell by the wayside like everyone else
[00:06.65]I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
[00:10.93]Our every moment, I start to replace
[00:15.08]'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say
[00:19.43]
[00:19.43]When you hurt under the surface
[00:23.61]Like troubled water running cold
[00:30.15]Well, time can heal, but this won't
[00:35.45]
[00:35.45]So, before you go
[00:42.91]Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
[00:49.14]If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
[00:53.53]So, before you go
[01:00.76]Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
[01:06.23]It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
[01:10.67]So, before you go
[01:20.20]
[01:20.20]Was never the right time, whenever you called
[01:23.91]Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
[01:28.09]Our every moment, I start to replay
[01:32.36]But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
[01:36.51]
[01:36.51]When you hurt under the surface
[01:41.00]Like troubled water running cold
[01:47.31]Well, some can heal, but this won't
[01:53.32]
[01:53.32]So, before you go
[02:00.33]Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
[02:06.24]If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
[02:10.58]So, before you go
[02:17.63]Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
[02:23.37]It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
[02:27.73]So, before you go
[02:33.14]
[02:33.14]Would we be better off by now
[02:37.33]If I'd have let my walls come down?
[02:41.64]Maybe, I guess we'll never know
[02:45.17]You know, you know
[02:51.62]
[02:51.62]Before you go
[02:55.83]Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
[03:01.70]If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
[03:06.17]So, before you go
[03:13.06]Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
[03:18.86]It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
[03:23.45]So, before you go
