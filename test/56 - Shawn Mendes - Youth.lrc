[00:08.16]Here I am, stuck on this couch
[00:10.98]Scrolling through my notes
[00:13.10]Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
[00:18.05]
[00:18.05]Waking up to headlines
[00:20.35]Filled with devastation again
[00:22.80]My heart is broken
[00:24.78]But I keep going
[00:29.06]
[00:29.06]Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
[00:33.20]No, I won't let it change me
[00:36.97]Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
[00:41.45]Now, I know it

[01:10.61]Knowing what's outside
[01:12.90]Feeling hopeless
[01:15.28]I need focus
[01:17.91]
[01:17.91]You hit me with words I never heard
[01:21.27]Come out your mouth
[01:22.63]To be honest
[01:24.88]I don't want it, no
[01:27.58]
