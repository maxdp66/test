[00:06.36]This night is cold in the kingdom
[00:09.31]I can feel you fade away
[00:12.56]From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
[00:15.65]Your steps keep me awake
[00:18.19]
[00:18.19]Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
[00:21.48]I once was a man with dignity and grace
[00:24.69]Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
[00:27.77]So please, please
[00:30.78]
[00:30.78]Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
[00:34.30]A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
[00:37.20]If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
[00:40.55]If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
[00:43.42]Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
[00:46.71]Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
[00:49.84]If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
[00:53.29]If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
[00:57.33]
[00:57.33]I hold on to little pieces of what we were
[01:03.76]I know we're long gone, but take it easy
[01:07.06]Because it hurts
[01:09.69]
[01:09.69]Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
[01:12.79]I once was a girl with dignity and grace
[01:16.13]Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
[01:19.18]So please, please
[01:22.23]
[01:22.23]Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
[01:25.48]A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
[01:28.66]If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
[01:32.02]If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
[01:34.66]Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
[01:38.10]Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
[01:41.49]If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
[01:44.71]If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
[01:47.67]
[01:47.67]And I can't stop myself from falling down
[01:54.00]And I can't stop myself from falling down
[02:00.35]And I can't stop myself from falling down
[02:05.97]And I can't stop myself from falling down
[02:13.44]
[02:13.44]Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
[02:16.22]A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
[02:19.90]If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
[02:23.03]If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
[02:26.10]Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
[02:29.42]Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
[02:32.57]If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
[02:35.68]If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
[02:38.97]If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
[02:42.25]If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
