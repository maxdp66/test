[00:16.26]Tell me what you're crying for
[00:19.64]I'll wipe your tears, oh love
[00:22.77]If your soul is aching love
[00:26.41]We'll comfort you for sure
[00:28.95]
[00:28.95]If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
[00:35.74]It don't matter where you are, I'll run to your front door
[00:42.69]When my head goes in different directions
[00:46.40]You know my heart's never on the move
[00:49.67]And in the dark times, you don't have to question
[00:52.81]If I'm a hundred with you
[00:56.64]
[00:56.64]You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
[01:00.58]It won't keep us apart
[01:03.12]You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
[01:07.40]Just to get to your heart
[01:09.99]If we're caught in a wave
[01:13.45]Baby, we'll make a way
[01:16.92]You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
[01:21.12]It won't keep us apart
[01:28.61]
[01:28.61]Love, between our love
[01:35.82]Love, between our love
[01:37.76]
[01:37.76]Shadows play on idle hands
[01:41.80]I lose myself, I do
[01:44.90]But I've found my way to velvet sands
[01:48.78]I'll crash right into you
[01:51.25]
[01:51.25]If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
[01:58.31]It don't matter where were we are
[02:02.38]You're still the one I choose
[02:05.63]When my head goes in different directions
[02:08.54]You know my heart's never on the move
[02:11.76]And in the dark times you don't have to question
[02:15.07]If I'm a hundred with you
[02:18.13]
[02:18.13]You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
[02:22.65]It won't keep us apart
[02:25.38]You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
[02:30.36]Just to get to your heart
[02:32.13]If we're caught in a wave (in a wave)
[02:36.40]Baby, we'll make a way
[02:39.01]You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
[02:43.01]It won't keep us apart
[02:51.52]
[02:51.52]Love, between our love
[02:57.46]Love, between our love
[02:59.76]
[02:59.76]You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
[03:03.70]It won't keep us apart
[03:06.78]You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
[03:11.44]Just to get to your heart
[03:13.45]If we're caught in a wave
[03:16.67]Baby, we'll make a way
[03:20.14]You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
[03:24.31]It won't keep us apart
