[00:20.00]We talked 'bout nothing at all all night
[00:27.00]We slept 'til the Earth turned one time and woke in the dark
[00:34.68]These walls stronger than steel and stone
[00:40.03]Still we're waking all our neighbors up
[00:46.14]Stay 'til the winter's done
[00:50.00]Tell my friends I'm never coming home, aah
[00:56.30]
[00:56.30]'Cause I'm lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh
[01:05.95]Getting lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh
[01:14.39]I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you
[01:29.00]I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you
[01:36.08]
[01:36.08]Your veins are rushing with stars untamed
[01:44.08]A shock to the heart, lighting
[01:47.96]Your body's my drug
[01:53.52]So bright you block the sun
[01:56.95]We keep waking all our neighbors up
[02:02.16]Stay 'til the winter's done
[02:06.61]And tell my friends I'm never coming home, aah
[02:12.29]
[02:12.29]'Cause I'm lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh
[02:22.45]Getting lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh
[02:31.05]I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you
[02:45.76]I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you
[03:10.00]
[03:10.00]I'm lost on you
